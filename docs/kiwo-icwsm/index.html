				In today's data-driven world, organizations derive insights from massive amounts of data through large scale statistical machine learning models. However, statistical techniques can be easy to <i>fool</i> with adversarial instances (a neural network can predict a non-extremist as an extremist by mere presence of the word Jihad), which raises question in <i>Data Quality</i>. In high stakes decision making problems, such as <i>cyber social threats</i>, it is highly sensitive to classify a non-extremist as an extremist and vice-versa. Data quality is good if the data possesses adequate domain coverage and the labels contain adequate semantics. For example, is the semantics of an extremist vs. non-extremist vis-a-vis the word <i>Jihad</i> captured in the label (adequate semantics in labels)? Also, are there enough non-extremists with the word Jihad in the training data from the perspective of religion, hate, or ideology? Thus semantic annotation of the data, beyond mere labels attached to data instances, can significantly improve the robustness of model outcomes and ensure that the model has learned from trustworthy, knowledge-guided data standards. It is important to note that the knowledge-guided standards help <i>de-bias</i> the data if specified correctly (contextualized de-biasing extremist behavior data from bias towards the word Jihad). Therefore, in addition to trust in the robustness of outcomes, knowledge guided data creation also enables fair and ethical practices during real-world deployment of machine learning in high stakes decision making. We denote such data as <strong>Explainable Data</strong>. In this tutorial of type <u>course and case-studies</u>, we detail how to construct Explainable Data using various expert resources and knowledge graphs. All the materials (resources and implementations) presented during the tutorial will be made available on: <a href =https://aiisc.ai/kiwo-icwsm>KIWO-ICWSM</a>, a week before the tutorial. We plan a 90 minute tutorial (Intermediate Level) with 2 breaks (5 mins each).

				<strong>The current landscape of AI (30 mins)</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="text">
				In this section, we cover AI systems that have been developed in the field of consumer health question answering, mental health care informatics, crisis response, addiction response and cyber social harassment \cite{he2020infusing,kursuncu2018s,kursuncu2019modeling,wang2019balanced}\cite{lamy2020listed}. We discuss the techniques and present a comprehensive survey of datasets used to train AI systems for social and public health \cite{olteanu2019social}\cite{yang2020towards}. We evaluate the datasets in terms of:
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Domain Coverage - </strong> Does the dataset represent the population across Spatio-temporal and thematic variations? For example, we can bootstrap a sparse, region-specific dataset using a domain-specific Ontology to be applicable in a different region (Using opioid crisis analysis in the midwest to understand the opioid epidemic in Ohio).</li>
					<li><strong>Adequacy of labels in capturing the semantics - </strong> Do the dataset labels contain enough information to model and understand the context? Consider studying suicide risk severity in crisis scenarios. The labels suicidal indication, ideation, behavior, and attempt, which are supported by a clinically accepted questionnaire (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale \cite{gaur2019knowledge}), captures the context more meaningfully than no risk, low risk, moderate risk, or severe risk.</li>
					<li><strong>Hidden Biases - </strong>Does the dataset have inherent biases that machine learning won’t find on its own? Consider a study of religion, ideology, and hate; aggregating the population over these categories introduces inherent aggregation biases (a particular religion or ideology in association with extremism) that knowledge can effectively identify.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p class="text">We motivate the need for Explainable Data to train machine learning models whose outcomes can be trusted to be robust and fair when deployed in high stakes decision-making applications, especially about cyber social threats and public health.</p>

			<p class="text"><strong>Explainable Data: Guidelines and Evaluation (30 mins)</strong></p>
			<p class="text">We present our work on creating Explainable Data, including use-cases from mental health care informatics, crisis response, Addictions response and cyber social harassment \cite{gaur2019knowledge,kursuncu2019modeling,wijesiriwardene2020alone}. We show that domain experts and end-users trust outcomes from models trained on these datasets to be accurate in their predictions and reliably de-biased \cite{gaur2020semantics}. As an example, we created a dataset from the dark web curated from drug abuse ontology. The drug entities are extracted from product descriptions using ontology mappings. Those drug entities helped the domain experts extract social media opinions about different drugs being sold in marketplaces. When the deep learning model is trained on this kind of data, we can explain the predictions to domain experts which entity or layer on the model contributed to such prediction as we had a good handle on how the dataset is created \cite{Yadav2020-dq}\cite{daniulaityte2020dao}\cite{lamy2020listed}.</p>

			<p class="text"><strong>Explainable Data: Guidelines and Evaluation (30 mins)</strong></p>
			<p class="text">Lastly, we present general guidelines for Explainable Data creation and evaluation metrics to assess/analyze the extent to which models trained on the datasets are explainable and trustable. To conclude, we briefly discuss future directions for data creation with higher-level aims such as generalizability to abstractly related fields (Eg: puzzle-solving in relation to molecular design).</p>

			<p class = 'text'>
				ICWSM is a forum for researchers from multiple disciplines to share knowledge, discuss ideas, exchange information, and learn about cutting-edge research in diverse fields with the common theme of online social media. ICWSM is a singularly fitting venue for research that <strong>blends social science and computational approaches to answer important and challenging questions about human social behavior through social media while advancing computational tools for vast and unstructured data</strong>. This overall theme of this tutorial includes research in new perspectives in social theories and computational algorithms for analyzing social media. The tutorial will describe methods for domain specific dataset curation aligning with the interdisciplinary character of ICWSM. This tutorial will bring researchers and practitioners together at the confluence of contextualized knowledge representation, reasoning, semantic linking, natural language processing, and deep learning.
			</p>
			<p class="text">
				Essentially, the tutorial will provide the audience an opportunity to learn more about the effectiveness of contextualized dataset in explainable AI. It will convince the attendee on the value of domain knowledge-enhanced AI techniques  to overcome obstacles in explaining social good domain results, and better manage the lack of high-quality training data and poor interpretability they currently face. Similar to our recent and past tutorials, we will have comprehensive web resource for the benefit of the community.

			</p>
			<p class="text">
				This is the first time the highlighted tutors are delivering a tutorial together, albeit having worked together on various talks and presentations at PyData and Health-Science Conferences. 				While past tutorials and presentations have covered incorporating knowledge into the training methodology, we explain how knowledge is used to enhance the dataset set used for training in this tutorial \cite{gaur2020knowledge,gaur2019shades}. Such knowledge guided data enrichment is easy for DEs and end-users to understand, enabling their trust in outcomes of models. Additional benefits include generalizable and reliable behavior across training methods and tasks on similar data.
