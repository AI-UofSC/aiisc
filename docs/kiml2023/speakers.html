              <br>
              <br>  

              <a href="#">Abstract :</a>  Deep reinforcement learning has recently been used to train deep neural networks (DNNs) as heuristic functions to solve planning problems. While this approach has resulted in successfully solving planning problems with little to no domain-specific knowledge, specifying a goal to a DNN requires having prior knowledge about what states meet that goal specification and potentially requires re-training the DNN for that particular goal. To address this problem, we introduce a method of training a DNN to estimate the distance between a given state and a set of states, where a set of states is represented as a set of ground atoms in first-order logic. We then use first-order logic to specify goals and use answer set programming to obtain a set of ground atoms that represents that goal. As a result, one can invent new properties in first-order logic and need only specify what properties a goal state should or should not have without any need to know what states actually meet the specification. In our experiments with the Rubik's cube, we show that we can specify and reach goals without any need to re-train the DNN.

              <br>
              <br>  

              <a href="#">Abstract :</a>  In the era of Large Language Models, there is still a need for interpretable and reliable language understanding. In pursuit of this, inspired by  the masked language modeling setting of large language models, I will present our new neuro-symbolic framework for self-supervised rule learning from natural language. The framework is composed of three primary components (a) Semantic Parser to translate text to logic and logic to text; (b) A rule learner that takes in logic as input and output learnt rules based on self-supervision; (c) A reasoner that can reason over the rules and inform the semantic parser, the rule learner, and perform aspects of neuro-symbolic inference. In this talk, I will introduce the framework and go into the details of each of the above components. Our initial results have shown improved results in triple extraction tasks for semantic parsing and relation linking for the self-supervised rule learning work. The integration of all the three components of the framework is still in progress .

              Additionally, invited speakers may submit an invited paper that the organization will review and comment on. All forms of papers will be reviewed by an experienced multidisciplinary program committee for their contributions in terms of the novelty of the work and relatedness to the workshop program. The majority of the above program committee members have already been contacted and have confirmed their participation in the program committee, ensuring to have multiple representatives from disciplines such as information science, cognitive science, cybersecurity, healthcare, and other societal or high-stake decision-making applications.

            <p align="justify">Research in artificial intelligence and data science is accelerating rapidly due to an unprecedented explosion in the amount of information on the web.
              In parallel, we noticed immense growth in the construction and utility of the knowledge network from Google, Netflix, NSF, and NIH.</p>
            <p align="justify">However, current methods risk an unsatisfactory ceiling of applicability due to shortcomings in bringing homogeneity between knowledge graphs, data mining, and deep learning.
              In this changing world, retrospective studies for building state-of-the-art AI and Data science systems have raised concerns on trust, traceability, and interactivity for prospective applications in healthcare, finance, and crisis response.</p>
            <p align="justify">We believe the paradigm of <i>knowledge-infused mining and learning</i>  would account for both pieces of knowledge that accrue from domain expertise and guidance from physical models. Further, it will allow the community to design new evaluation strategies that assess robustness and fairness across all comparable state-of-the-art algorithms. </p>
