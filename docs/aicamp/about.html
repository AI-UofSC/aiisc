        <p style="text-align: left;">Join us this Summer 2023 for a fun-filled, project-based learning in the Artificial Intelligence camp. The camp will promote interaction and exchange of ideas between AI researchers, practitioners, and students. Following the camp, the most promising high school students will be offered semester-wide internships with an intention to promote their interest in further education and translational AI research.</p>  -->
        

        <p>
            The goal of the Summer AI camp for High School students is to introduce the students to AI with the help of lectures, tutorials, and most importantly hands-on activities. Objective is to actively engage and inspire the students. Students are not required to know coding/programming in advance. But they do need to bring enthusiasm and curiosity!
        </p>

        <p>
            The AI summer Camp was held the week of June 19 at the AI Institute of South Carolina (AIISC) on the USC campus (AIISC on the Google Maps).
        </p>

        <p>
            For AIISC, organizing this camp is a major activity to fullfill its mission in broadaening participation in computing (BPC), DEI, and workforce development. The 2023 Summer AI camp was specially organized for the students of the Richland County School District Two (Richland Two). It is a nationally recognized school district located in suburban Columbia, South Carolina, United States, in the northeast section of Richland County. It is one of the fastest-growing districts in South Carolina. It served 28,296 students last year. Students at these schools are very diverse and have a high Pupil in Poverty (PIP) status. The PIP represents the proportion of students living in poverty. Total pupils in poverty (PIP), indicating financial need is over 55% Demographics is: 51% male, 49% female; 60%-African American; 20%-White; 12%-Hispanic; 5%-Other; and 3%-Asian.
        </p>

        <p>
            The AI Camp had nine sessions of around three hours each (M-Th: 9am to 3pm; F: 9am to noon). The sessions were planned with a view of high engagement (the feedback shows we succeeded very well), through a combination of short lectures with lot so visuals, demos and short videos, and most importantly, hands-on activities. The camp participants did not require to have prior coding experience but all were required to bring a laptop. Organizing this camp required a very large commitment from the AIISC, which involved Prof. Amit Sheth and 10 of his graduate students throughout the week. Thursday morning session was conducted by Prof. Biplav Srivastava and four of his students.
