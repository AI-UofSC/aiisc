											CCS Concepts: • Artificial Intelligence → Causal AI; • Machine Learning → Explainability; • Natural Language Understanding; • Ontologies
→ Knowledge Graphs;

									<p>
										Improving the performance and explanations of ML algorithms is
a priority for adoption by humans in the real world. In critical domains such as healthcare, such technology has significant potential
to reduce the burden on humans and considerably reduce manual
assessments by providing quality assistance at scale. In today’s data
driven world, artificial intelligence (AI) systems are still experiencing issues with bias, explainability, and human-like reasoning and
interpretability. Causal AI is the technique that can reason and make
human like choices making it possible to go beyond narrow Machine learning based techniques and can be integrated into human
decision making. It also offers intrinsic explainability, new domain
adaptability, bias free predictions and works with datasets of all
sizes. In this tutorial of type lecture style we detail how a richer
representation of causality in AI systems using a knowledge graph
(KG) based approach is needed for intervention and counterfactual
reasoning (Figure 1), how do we get to model based and domain
explainability, how causal representations helps in web and health
care.

									<h2 id="schedule">1 TUTORIAL SCHEDULE AND ACTIVITIES</h2>
									
									<p>This tutorial has the following four major modules as follows:</p>
									

									<ul>
										<li>
											<strong>(10 mins) The current landscape of AI:</strong> 
											We begin the session
motivating the need for causal AI in healthcare and when analyzing the web based data. We’ll give instances from actual
web examples that highlight the limitations of the available
statistical and data-powered AI Systems. The opening session
will emphasize the need for causal AI for creating comprehensible explainable AI systems.
										</li>
										<br>
										<li>
											<strong>
												(25 mins) Causal Knowledge Graph Development:
											</strong>
											CausalKG
											is a step toward symbolic AI for knowledge-infused learning
											that is causality-based. We demonstrate that systems using
											CausalKG don’t just learn from correlations; instead, have a
											causal understanding of the environment around them [3].
											In addition to causality, CausalKG uses KG which also represents space, time, and interactions. The AI algorithms used
											today rely on uniformly distributed, independent data which
											are unable to deduce hypothetical, interventional scenarios or
											out-of-distribution situations. We show how to enable interventional and counterfactual reasoning that may be derived
											utilizing observational data and domain expert knowledge
											and how CausalKG can be utilized to infuse current KGs with
											causal knowledge of the domain. We discuss on building a
											CausalKG which has the benefit of incorporating causality
											into reasoning and prediction processes, such as the understanding, planning, and diagnosing of medical conditions for
											example.
										</li>
										<br>
										<li>
										<strong>(25 mins) Ontology and Knowledge based inference for
											causal Explanation: </strong>	We construct an inference system to
											record explanations based on causal assertions using an ontology in the form of relationships and sub class hierarchy.
											We begin by ontology construction that enables us to express how one fact leads to another and how one fact explains another. We provide a formal set of pattern extractions, causal
											relationships that move from causal claims to explanations.
											These patterns exhibit the ontological principles considered
											necessary for reaching judgments on explanatory statements
											and algorithm predictions. We also present Drug abuse Ontology as an ontological framework that recognizes the patterns
											in web based data and in the mental healthcare domain.
									</li>
									<br>

									<li>
										<strong>
											(25 mins) Applications in web and healthcare : 
										</strong>
										The COVID19 Pandemic has brought attention to the disparity in access
										to mental health services. Internet users have turned to online forums like Reddit to share their experiences. There are
										clinically accepted causal interpretations and semantics for diagnosing mental illnesses. In this session, we propose a causal
										process reasoning infused machine learning techniques called
										Causal Process Knowledge Infused Reasoning (CPR). CPR
										uses mental health causal models to guide the learning of
										neuro-symbolic approximation functions (reasoners) to capture causal model conditional probabilities. We assess the
										efficacy of CPR using task descriptions, datasets, and baseline
										techniques for suicidality context identification and intervention. We demonstrate a system that deploys CPR on Reddit’s
										social media (SocMedia) posts showing CPR’s ability to scale
										to web data. We further discuss possible improvements to
										causal theories that may enhance performance on these tasks
										and have broader mental health care implications.

						<h2 id="topic">3 TOPIC AND RELEVANCE</h2>
						<p>
							SocMedia emerged as the go-to platform for mental health (MH)
support for patients seeking Mental Health Care (MHCare). The
transition of patients from clinical settings to SocMedia has been
facilitated by peer-support groups and the lack of social stigma. For
example, in order to find clues that can demonstrate a correlation or
cause between various MH illnesses and a patient’s propensity for
suicide, researchers have begun examining SocMedia content. In
that case, this tutorial is relevant to develop causal AI systems for a
deeper understanding of SocMedia conversations that may result in
policy decisions due to the abundance of SocMedia conversations
in the areas of health care, mental health, substance use, etc. that
are available on the internet whereas surface level deep learning
systems cannot achieve such goals.

					<h2 id="audience">4 TUTORIAL AUDIENCE AND PREREQUISITES</h2>
					<p>
						Researchers from academia, business, and healthcare professionals can participate in this tutorial to discuss the intersection of
causal representation, reasoning, semantic linking, NLP, and deep
learning. Since the tutorial is taught in a lecture-style format, a
fundamental knowledge of causal systems, Knowledge Graph (KG),
Ontology, and natural language processing (NLP) is preferred. This
will make it possible for the public to understand the limitations
of statistical AI and to monitor the development of AI as it moves
toward neuro-symbolic AI. The lesson will include enough examples
and use cases of causal AI systems and techniques. The present state
of AI/ML systems for web based analysis of health care will be explained to newcomers interested in these systems. The methodology
and datasets provided in the tutorial will be valued by experienced
participants as viable solutions to common technical challenges in
the social good domains. We welcome additional studies using our
datasets and methodology from other researchers in order to deepen
our understanding of causal AI systems for web and health care.

							<p>

							
							Through the development of domain-specific data sets, cuttingedge frameworks, and computational methods for comprehending user language and asynchronous conversations on
a variety of platforms, we investigated a new healthcare dimension of SocMedia like Mental Health Care, and User interactions. Through the use of these methods, we hope to
(a) build the new clinical process guidelines for patients and
develop task-based Order Sets (b) create actionable Order Sets
that are integrated into the system and aid medical professionals in making choices and avoiding delays and discrepancies
in diagnosis and treatment. (c) create process-guided explanation models that are simple for the end-user to comprehend
(d) create causal AI system using a knowledge-graph-based
methodology for better explainability, support for intervention and counterfactuals in social good domains.
