				During the last decade, traditional data-driven deep learning (DL)has shown remarkable success in essential natural language process-ing tasks, such as relation extraction. Yet, challenges remain in de-veloping artificial intelligence (AI) methods in real-world cases thatrequire explainability through human interpretable and traceableoutcomes. The scarcity of labeled data for downstream supervisedtasks and entangled embeddings produced as an outcome of self-supervised pre-training objectives also hinders interpretability andexplainability. Additionally, data labeling in multiple unstructureddomains, particularly healthcare and education, is computationallyexpensive as it requires a pool of human expertise. Consider Educa-tion Technology, where AI systems fall along a “capability spectrum”depending on how extensively they exploit various resources, suchas academic content, granularity in student engagement, academicdomain experts, and knowledge bases to identify concepts thatwould help achieve knowledge mastery for student goals. Likewise,the task of assessing human health using online conversationsraises challenges for current statistical DL methods through evolv-ing cultural and context-specific discussions. Hence, developingstrategies that merge AI with stratified knowledge to identify con-cepts that would delineate healthcare conversations patterns andhelp healthcare professionals decide. Such technological innova-tions are imperative as they provide consistency and explainabilityin outcomes. This tutorial discusses the notion of explainabilityand interpretability through the use of knowledge graphs in (1)Healthcare on the Web, (2) Education Technology. This tutorial willprovide details of knowledge-infused learning algorithms and itscontribution to explainability for the above two applications thatcan be applied to any other domain using knowledge graphs.

			<p class="text">
				Recently, there is increasing attention to developing methods toenable the easy adoption of AI in practice. These methods com-prise analyzability, interpretability, traceability, and explainabilityof AI models and its prediction using statistical natural languageprocessing (NLP), information extraction (IE), and deep learning(DL). At the center of this upsurge are the knowledge graphs (KG),a large network of entities, their semantic types, properties, andrelationships between entities. For instance,Wikidata [16], DB-pedia [12], UMLS [1], ConceptNet [15]The utility of KG in DLis to provide relative importance scores (or semantic weighting) tolearnable features for interpretation of the outcomes[cite, cite].A recent study[3]leverage the Columbia-Suicide Severity RatingScale (C-SSRS) to clinically assess the varying suicidality on Redditand identify behavioral cues to extract supportive users, whichimproved the recall of the overall process. Likewise, in the domainof education, the use of deep learning and knowledge infusionmethods to extend Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and DeepKnowledge Tracing (DKT) pair the capability to present concept-level masteries for easy intervention with the traditional predictionof student’s overall mastery. Further, the student’s goal contextu-alizes the knowledge graph with a relevant curriculum, whereashis concept-level mastery can be used to personalize the knowl-edge graph. Which enables the intervention layer to generate betterlearning outcomes. For instance, a recent study used Blooms’ Taxon-omy to extend the BKT model of a student to interpretably evaluateknowledge mastery[2, 10, 11]. Such utilization of KG/taxonomiesis of immediate concentration in the domain of explainable AI anddata science, a paradigm of importance to the community in theBig Data Analytics Conference. Through demos, implementabledetails, and resources, the focus of the tutorial is to provide direc-tions in developing AI methods involving the fusion of knowledgefor contextualizing the content, generating attention weights, and evaluating predictions to reason over the healthcare state or learn-ing activity of an individual for improving the human experiencewith AI system. Beginners in the area of Knowledge Graphs wouldlearn an introduction to the knowledge graph, its construction,and utility through knowledge-infused learning. Experts in the do-main of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and its application in AI wouldappreciate the capability of knowledge-infused learning in gener-ating explanations to classification problems in Healthcare on theWeb and deriving concepts mastery in Education. Moreover, theattendees will gain in-depth understanding of the methods usedfor fusing knowledge through demonstrations, theory, and concep-tual outlining of the tutorial. The tutorial is appropriate for thecommunity engaging in the Conference on Big Data Analytics asit highlights the essence of contextualized knowledge representa-tion and knowledge-based systems in facilitating human-guidedinterventions in Education and Healthcare on the Web for effectiveoutcomes. It will provide the community with tools to overcomeobstacles in social good domains that lack high-quality trainingdata and poor interpretability. We believe the resources providedduring the tutorial will further the research in responsible datascience in healthcare and education.

				The critical issues in healthcare, particularly mental healthcare,such as estimating the mental health state of an individual and ed-ucation, such as calibrating and improving knowledge mastery ofan individual, have been highlighted by research in artificial intelli-gence. The methods focus on principles of IE(e.g., predicate inven-tion[9]), DL (e.g., convolutional neural networks[14], deep knowl-edge tracing using the recurrent neural networks[17]), and behav-ioral NLP to predict either severity of mental illness or knowledgemastery in education. No doubt, deep learning-based approacheshave achieved state-of-the-art performance in knowledge stateand mental state prediction. Still, it neither provides explicit ex-planations of its outcome nor provides actionable suggestions onachieving clinical relevance in healthcare or desired mastery ineducation. The domain of healthcare and education technology isstocked with publicly available data in various forms (e.g., socialmedia crawls, epubs/ebooks/PDFs). Leveraging such a large corpusof unstructured text for improving counseling services in healthcareand learning outcomes in education, a paradigm coalesced withexternal curated knowledge is desired. This tutorial presents a para-digm, Knowledge-infused Learning, which describes methodologiesof incorporating domain-knowledge in deep learning approachesfor bringing consistency and robustness in predictions. Specifi-cally, we will provide implementable details on Shallow Infusion,Semi-Deep Infusion, and Deep Infusion of Knowledge, which aremethods to augment auxiliary knowledge for helping the mentalhealthcare providers educationist to understand key features con-tributing to the current knowledge state or mental health state of anindividual. Further, we will discuss methods for contextualizationand abstraction of unstructured text, independently in healthcareand education using knowledge graphs/taxonomy[3, 5, 7, 8], toderive actionable knowledge for mental healthcare providers andeducationists. We will describe strategies for evaluating methods.

					We begin with the introduction to Knowledge Graph-based Learn-ing comprising of (a) description on the role of KGs in model inter-pretability, traceability of predictions to a KG, in achieving explain-ability of the outcome with examples and (b) procedure to constructKGs and use them at scale. Following which, we would motivate theaudience on the concept of Knowledge-infused AI which would in-clude (a) the theoretical underpinnings of knowledge-infused learn-ing, (b) the different alternatives for combining KGs and Learningmethods, (c) KG-based AI frameworks in practice, and (d) differentevaluation strategies for such frameworks. Thereafter, we wouldgive a preface of using KGs towards improving learning outcomes(e.g. Amazon Alexa, Coursera, eDX) and in healthcare informat-ics. This introductory session would cover prior research coveringshallow and semi-deep infusion of knowledge in deep learning ormachine learning procedures [6]. Subsequently, we will take uptwo key applications to provide a practical tour on the theme ofthe tutorial:
