    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>AI Institute of South Carolina (AIISC) seeks to make a significant majority of the tools, data and ontologies developed as parts of its research under an open source license for use by fellow researchers and often for broader use, especially when quality of software and tool are ready for external use. We also endeavor to support the evolving standards and specifications in a variety of related fields through W3C and other channels. AIISC will continue to develop community resources such as datasets, open source tools, and public services, which are hosted for significant periods after the end of respective projects and/or made available through public or open source distribution channels.</p>

A report by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) shows that 80% of the patients suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) have suicidal behavior, 5-10% of whom commit suicide. While multiple initiatives have been developed and implemented for suicide prevention, a key challenge has been the social stigma associated with mental disorders, which deters patients from seeking help or sharing their experiences directly with others including clinicians. This is particularly true for teenagers and younger adults where suicide is the second highest cause of death in the US Prior research involving surveys and questionnaires (e.g. PHQ-9) for suicide risk prediction failed to provide a quantitative assessment of risk that informed timely clinical decision-making for intervention. Our interdisciplinary study concerns the use of Reddit as an unobtrusive data source for gleaning information about suicidal tendencies and other related mental health conditions afflicting depressed users. We provide details of our learning framework that incorporates domain-specific knowledge to predict the severity of suicide risk for an individual. Our approach involves developing a suicide risk severity lexicon using medical knowledge bases and suicide ontology to detect cues relevant to suicidal thoughts and actions. We also use language modeling, medical entity recognition, and normalization and negation detection to create a dataset of 2181 redditors that have discussed or implied suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt. Given the importance of clinical knowledge, our gold standard dataset of 500 redditors (out of 2181) was developed by four practicing psychiatrists following the guidelines outlined in Columbia.Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), with the pairwise annotator agreement of 0.79 and group-wise agreement of 0.73. Compared to the existing four-label classification scheme (no risk, low risk, moderate risk, and high risk), our proposed C-SSRS-based 5-label classification scheme distinguishes people who are supportive, from those who show different severity of suicidal tendency. Our 5-label classification scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes by improving the graded recall by 4.2% and reducing the perceived risk measure by 12.5%. Convolutional neural network (CNN) provided the best performance in our scheme due to the discriminative features and use of domain-specific knowledge resources, in comparison to SVM-L that has been used in the state-of-the-art tools over similar dataset.

        <b>Characterization of Time-variant and Time-invariant Assessment of Suicidality on Reddit using C-SSRS : </b>
      <span>
        Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S (1999-2019). However, predicting when someone will attempt or complete suicide has been nearly impossible. In the modern world, many individuals suffering from mental illness seek emotional support and advice on well-known and easily-accessible social media platforms such as Reddit.   While prior artificial intelligence research has demonstrated the ability to extract valuable information from social media on suicidal thoughts and behaviors, these efforts have not considered both severity and temporality of risk. The insights made possible by access to such data have enormous clinical potential - most dramatically envisioned as a trigger to employ timely and targeted interventions (i.e. voluntary and involuntary psychiatric hospitalization) to save lives. In this work, we address this knowledge gap by developing natural datasets of users experiencing suicide-related ideations, suicide-related behaviors or suicide attempt (https://zenodo.org/record/2667859#.YCwdTR1OlQI) manifested through their communication on r/SuicideWatch and associated mental health subreddits. Through a widely recognized questionnaire to assess suicide risk severity, The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, the domain experts in the study annotated 448 users with following labels: Supportive (new add to C-SSRS and specific to social media), Suicide Ideation, Suicide Behavior, Suicide Attempt. High standards in annotation were maintained with substantial inter-rater agreement of 0.76.

    <ul><li><strong>SoCS Ontology for Crisis Coordination (SOCC)</strong>: We extend the concepts of domain knowledge­-driven models, MOAC- Management Of A Crisis ontology (Limbu 2012), and UNOCHA's HXL- Humanitarian Exchange Language (Keßler et al. 2013) ontology, with required but missing concepts for organizing data during crisis response coordination for seeker and supplier behavior, and indicators of resource needs using a lexicon. For example, the 'shelter' class contains words 'emergency center,' 'tent,' and 'shelter,' along with lexical alternatives. For the present demonstration, we focus on three resource categories: food, shelter and medical needs. Thus, we endeavor to exploit a minimum, but always expandable subset that provides the maximum coverage while controlling false alarms. For creating lexicons of indicator words for concepts, we relied on various documents collected via interactions with domain experts (Flach et al. 2013), our Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) training, Rural Domestic Preparedness Consortium training, and publically available references (Homeland Security 2010; FEMA 2012; OCHA,Verity 2011). Using a first aid handbook (Swienton and Subbarao 2012), we created an extensive 'medical' subset of emergency indicators, where we identified words which pertained specifically to first aid or injuries and included those words along with variations in tense (i.e., breath, breathing, breathes) and common abbreviations (i.e. mouth to mouth, mouth 2 mouth, CPR). A local expert with FEMA experience augmented the model with additional indicators and provided anecdotal context. The current model with food, medical, and shelter resource indicators contain 43 concepts and 45 relationships. We created this domain model in the OWL language using the Protégé ontology editor (Protégé 2013). Each type of disaster is listed as an entity type with indicators for that disaster listed as individuals under a corresponding indicator entity. Therefore a relationship is declared stating that a particular disaster concept, say Flood, relates by property 'has_a_positive_indicator', with 'Flood_i' indicator entity, that includes all words under that heading. Each disaster has a declared negative relationship with the negative indicator list (e.g., 'erotic' under sexual words indicators) under the entity name Negative_Indicator_i. Finally resources are declared as individuals under the appropriate entity in the same way, but relationships are not explicitly stated with any disaster in order to provide flexibility.

    <li><strong>Sensor and Sensor Network (SSN) Ontology</strong>: The Sensor and Sensor Network ontology, known as the SSN ontology, answers the need for a domain-independent and end-to-end model for sensing applications by merging sensor-focused (e.g. SensorML), observation-focused (e.g. Observation &amp; Measurement) and system-focused views. It covers the sub-domains which are sensor-specific such as the sensing principles and capabilities and can be used to define how a sensor will perform in a particular context to help characterize the quality of sensed data or to better task sensors in unpredictable environments. Although the ontology leaves the observed domain unspecified, domain semantics, units of measurement, time and time series, and location and mobility ontologies can be easily attached when instantiating the ontology for any particular sensors in a domain. The alignment between the SSN ontology and the DOLCE Ultra Lite upper ontology has helped to normalise the structure of the ontology to assist its use in conjunction with ontologies or linked data resources developed elsewhere.
