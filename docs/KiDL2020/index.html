				Recent advances in statistical and data-driven deep learning 
				demonstrate significant success in natural language understanding 
				without using prior knowledge, especially in structured and generic domains, 
				where data is abundant. On the other hand, in text processing problems that  
				are dynamic and impact the society at large, existing data-dependent, 
				state-of-the-art deep learning methods remain vulnerable to veracity 
				considerations and especially, high volume that masks small, emergent signals. 
				Statistical natural language processing methods have shown poor performance in 
				capturing: (1) Human well being online especially in evolving events 
				(e.g. mental health communications on Reddit, Twitter), (2) Culture and context 
				specific discussion on the web (e.g. humor detection, extremism on social media), 
				(3) Social Network Analysis (help-seeker and care-provider) during pandemic or 
				disaster scenarios, and (4) Explainable methods of learning that  drive technological 
				innovations and inventions for community betterment. In such social hypertext, 
				leveraging the semantic-web concept of knowledge graphs  is a promising approach to 
				the enhancement of deep learning and natural language processing.
			</p>
			<p class = 'text'>
				According to Piagetian human learning theory, the activation of existing schema 
				guides the apprehension of  experience  to support the generation of  context 
				sensitive  responses. Activating prior knowledge connects current and past 
				experience for identifying relations, supporting explanation, reducing ambiguity, 
				structuring  new knowledge, and application to novel materials. Further, 
				human learning does not necessarily rely on large amounts of (annotated) cases to proceed.
				Because prior knowledge is so powerful in human learning, its incorporation at 
				various levels of abstraction in deep learning could benefit outcomes. Example  
				the desiderata include compensating for data limitations, improving  inductive bias, 
				generating explainable outcomes and enabling trust. These are particularly useful 
				for data-limited but otherwise complex, evolving problems in domains such as  
				mental healthcare, online social threats and epidemic/pandemic.
			</p>
			<p class = 'text'>
				Despite the general agreement that structured prior knowledge and tacit knowledge 
				(the inferred outcome of a model) resulting from deep learning should be combined, 
				there has been little progress. Recent debates on
				<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/devils-in-the-details-in-bengio-marcus-ai-debate/"> Neuro-Symbolic AI </a>, 
				the inclusion of innate priors in <a href="https://www.abigailsee.com/2018/02/21/deep-learning-structure-and-innate-priors.html">deep learning</a>, 
				and <a href="https://vimeo.com/390814190">AI fireside chat </a> have identified knowledge-infused 
				learning  to improve explainability, interpretability, and trust in AI systems. 
			</p>
			<p class = 'text'>In this tutorial, we take use cases from the aforementioned two social good applications (Mental Health, Radicalization) and multimodal aspects of social media (e.g. scene understanding from images, video and text (hypermedia/hypertext) often found in documentation of critical events  to explore the modern aspect of hypertext using semantic web in the form of Knowledge Graphs (KG).  Specifically, the tutorial will provide a detailed walkthrough on Knowledge Graphs and their utility in developing knowledge-infusion techniques for interpretable and explainable learning for text, video, images, and graphical data on the web with the following agenda:
				Motivate the novel paradigm of knowledge-infused learning using computational learning and cognitive theories. 
				Describe the different forms of knowledge, methods of automatic modeling of KG, and infusion methods in deep/machine learning.
				Discuss application-specific evaluation methods specifically for explainability and reasoning using benchmark datasets and knowledge-resources that show promise in advancing the capabilities of deep learning.
				Future directions of KGs and robust learning for the Web and Society.

					The motivation for Knowledge Graph-infused Deep Learning <b>(30 minutes)</b>: 
					In this module, we will describe "Why do we need external knowledge in 
					learning"? We will explain the fundamental role of a relation-preserving 
					knowledge representation in learning from social media, scientific articles, 
					blog posts and graphics. We will describe Probably Approximately Correct 
					(PAC) learnability and Semantic theories of Robust logic as the foundational 
					piece for knowledge-infusion. Further, we address how these paradigms 
					manifest themselves in modeling prior knowledge and cognitive theories, which 
					constitute our understanding of context and relations in the social good domain.

				<li><p class = 'text'> 
					All about Knowledge Graphs <b>(60 minutes)</b>: There are multiple ways to represent 
					external knowledge, such as relational databases (or knowledge bases), flattened 
					taxonomies (or lexicons), Ontologies, and Knowledge Graphs. In this module, 
					we elaborate on these forms of external knowledge and  explain the following: 
					(1) What is a Knowledge Graph, (2) Knowledge Graphs and Domain-Specific Search 
					Problems, (3) Knowledge Graph Construction and Evolution, (4) Knowledge Graph 
					Completion and Sub-graph Creation. Furthermore, we introduce KG-driven unsupervised, 
					semi-supervised, and supervised methods of representation learning over unstructured 
					multimodal content.</p></li>

					Different Forms of Knowledge-Infusion and its Application <b>(60 minutes)</b>: In this 
					presentation, we describe three approaches to knowledge-infusion:
					<ol type = 'a'>
						<li><p class = 'text'>
							<b>Shallow Infusion</b>: Both the external knowledge and the method 
							of knowledge infusion is shallow, utilizing syntactic and 
							lexical knowledge in the form of word embedding models. 
						</p></li>
						<li><p class = 'text'>
							<b>Semi-Deep Infusion</b>: External knowledge is involved through 
							attention mechanisms or learnable knowledge constraints acting 
							as a sentinel to guide model learning.
						</p></li>
						<li><p class = 'text'>
							<b>Deep Infusion</b>:  Employs a stratified representation of knowledge 
							representing different levels of abstractions in different 
							layers of a deep learning model, to transfer knowledge that 
							aligns with the corresponding layer in the layered learning process.

				Hypertext research has been deeply interested in modeling of people, content, and network 
				on the web for knowledge discovery. The tutorial will describe methods for contextualization, 
				abstraction, and personalization aligning with the theme of “Hypertext and Social Good”. 
				This tutorial at ACM HT 2020 will bring researchers and practitioners together at the confluence 
				of contextualized knowledge representation, reasoning, semantic linking, natural language processing, 
				and deep learning.  
				Essentially, the tutorial will provide the audience an opportunity to learn more about a hybrid machine 
				learning approach for high impact problems. Toward the end, the attendees would appreciate knowledge-infused 
				AI as a promising, reliable and practical approach to overcome obstacles in social good domains regarding the 
				lack of high-quality training data and poor interpretability.
