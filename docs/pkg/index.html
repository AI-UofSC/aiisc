			<p class = 'text'>
				Personal knowledge graphs (PKG) encode the same information at an individual level and therefore varies widely. Constructing KGs that are widely used and extant online has been typically done manually over years. PKGs on the other hand require the processing of each person’s individual information and is constructed in automated fashion. Typically, a PKG formalizes expert information, either in clinical questionnaires or ontologies (e.g., Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO)), in terms of relevant relationships between entities. For instance, a knowledge graph (KG) for asthma can describe causes, symptoms, and treatments for asthma. APKG can be the subgraph containing just those causes, symptoms, and treatments that are applicable to a given user (or patient).
				The aim of the proposed book is to explore and structure the information on Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKG) which contains the information of entities personally related to other entities.  We have reviewed the literature, and it appears that there is no current book on this topic. Most of the research about Personal Knowledge Graphs is only available in research articles. Our aim is to present the state of the art advanced research on Personal Knowledge Graphs including methodologies, tools and applications.
