									<p>
										Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for mental healthcare (MHCare)
										have been ever-growing after realizing the importance of early

										interventions for patients with chronic mental health (MH) condi-
										tions. Social media (SocMedia) emerged as the go-to platform for

										supporting patients seeking MHCare. The creation of peer-support
										groups without social stigma has resulted in patients transitioning
										from clinical settings to SocMedia supported interactions for quick
										help. Researchers started exploring SocMedia content in search
										of cues that showcase correlation or causation between different
										MH conditions to design better interventional strategies. User-level
										Classification-based AI systems were designed to leverage diverse

										SocMedia data from various MH conditions, to predict MH condi-
										tions. Subsequently, researchers created classification schemes to

										measure the severity of each MH condition. Such ad-hoc schemes,
										engineered features, and models not only require a large amount of
										data but fail to allow clinically acceptable and explainable reasoning
										over the outcomes. To improve Neural-AI for MHCare, infusion of

										clinical symbolic knowledge that clinicans use in decision mak-
										ing is required. An impactful use case of Neural-AI systems in

										MH is conversational systems. These systems require coordination

										between classification and generation to facilitate humanistic con-
										versation in conversational agents (CA). Current CAs with deep

										language models lack factual correctness, medical relevance, and
										safety in their generations, which intertwine with unexplainable
										statistical classification techniques. This lecture-style tutorial will
										demonstrate our investigations into Neuro-symbolic methods of
										infusing clinical knowledge to improve the outcomes of Neural-AI
										systems to improve interventions for MHCare:
										
										<ul>
											<li>
												(a) We will discuss
										the use of diverse clinical knowledge in creating specialized datasets

										to train Neural-AI systems effectively. 

											</li>
											<br>
											<li>
												(b) Patients with cardiovas-
										cular disease express MH symptoms differently based on genderdifferences. We will show that knowledge-infused Neural-AI sys-
										tems can identify gender-specific MH symptoms in such patients.
											</li>
											<br>
											<li>
												(c) We will describe strategies for infusing clinical process knowl-
										edge as heuristics and constraints to improve language models in

										generating relevant questions and responses.
											</li>
											<br>
										</ul>

										

										

										
									</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2 id="schedule">1 TUTORIAL SCHEDULE AND ACTIVITIES</h2>
									
									<p>The tutorial will cover methodologies for classification, generation,
										and multi-task learning. Although we use MH has the use case,
										other application domains where domain and process knowledge
										are critical in decision making will benefit from the methods we
										will discuss. Six modules of the tutorial are:</p>
									

									<ul>
										<li>
											<strong>(15 mins) Introduction with Use Cases:</strong> We will begin the
session motivating the need for Knowledge-infusion based
neuro-symbolic AI technqiues for use in MHCare. Real-world
examples will be used to demonstrate limitations in current
statistical and data-driven AI Systems. This will highlight
the necessity of duality between data and knowledge for
developing explainable AI systems [16], as opposted to the
contemporary statistical AI and data driven approaches.
										</li>
										<br>
										<li>
											<strong>
												(30 mins) Explainable Data Creation:
											</strong>
											 Explainable data refers

to resources that leverage guidelines created by subject mat-
ter experts (SMEs) in labeling samples of the datasets. For in-
stance, “Reddit C-SSRS Dataset” uses SME-created Columbia

Suicide Severity Rating Scale as the scheme to annotate posts
from users writing on r/SuicideWatch subreddit [2, 6, 9]. We
will discuss four such datasets.
										</li>
										<br>
										<li>
										<strong>(30 mins) Knowledge-infusion for Classification: </strong>	Clas-
sification problems in MHCare require end-user clinician

to retrospect on the models’ outcomes and reason on it for
explanations, followed by documting the basis of decision

(diagnosis, treatment plan) made by the clinician. If the clas-
sification scheme is not grounded in clinical knowledge, it

would subject to varied interpretations and wrongful con-
clusions. In this module, we will discuss the use of expert

curated ontologies as the source of knowledge to be infused
in machine learning classifiers. Further, we will introduce
novel evaluation metrics for assessing the effectiveness of
the classifiers [2, 3, 13].
									</li>
									<br>

									<li>
										<strong>
											(25 mins) Knowledge-infusion for Language Generation
in Conversational Systems:
										</strong>
										 Drawing on the findings from

the infusion in classification-based AI systems, we will in-
vestigate parallel methods in generation-based AI systems

for conversational AI. In MHCare, question and response
generation are not simply conditional on the user query or
posts but rather retrieval of knowledge passages, context in
previous generated question or response, knowledge context disambiguation, and logical coherence is equally important
for consistent and conceptual-flow-based conversations. We
will discuss methods to achieve conceptual flow on MHCare
datasets [1, 5]. We will discuss the benefit evaluation metrics
based on pre-trained language models to assess AI systems
for generation.
									</li>
									<br>

									<li>
										<strong>
											(25 mins) Process Knowledge-infused Learning: 
										</strong>
										While
covering “knowledge-infusion for generation” we will be

focusing on making deep language models capable of gener-
ating questions and responses by designing new constraint-
based optimization functions [14]. Whereas, in this module,

we will enforce logical coherence constraints in deep lan-
guage models using (a) process knowledge-guided dataset

[8], and (b) constraint-based optimization function [12]. We

introduce novel evaluation metrics to better judge the per-
formance of AI System.
									</li>
									<br>

									<li>
										<strong>
											(30 mins) Knowledge-aware Multi-task Learning:
										</strong>
										 We de-
sign a multi-task learning framework for identifying MH

symptoms that consider gender language infused in user
social media posts using (a) how we built a massive data set
for task adaptation, (b) how knowledge aware task adaptive
models can help decision making process for clinicians, (c)
how to formulate a knowledge aware transformer model and
the sources of knowledge used in the design, and (d) how
our model provides the clinically relevant outcome [11].
