Despite the recent advancements in the field, AD is still far from achieving full autonomy due to core technical problems inherent in AD. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic AI and the methods for <b>knowledge-infused learning</b> are showing exciting ways of leveraging external knowledge within machine/deep learning solutions, with the potential benefits for interpretability, explainability, robustness, and transferability. In this tutorial, we will examine the use of knowledge-infused learning for three core state-of-the-art technical achievements within the AD domain. With a collaborative team from both academia and industry, we will demonstrate recent innovations using real-world datasets.\n  </p>\n    </v-row>\n    <v-row no-gutters \n      class=\"pt-8\"\n      align=\"center\"\n      justify=\"center\">\n      <h1 class=\"text-h4 font-weight-thin mb-4\">\n              Speakers\n      </h1>\n    </v-row>\n    <v-row \n      class=\"pb-8\"\n      align=\"center\"\n      justify=\"center\"\n      no-gutters>\n      <template v-for=\"(author, idx) in authors\">\n        <biography-card :person=\"author\" :key=\"idx\"/>\n      </template>\n    </v-row>\n    <v-row no-gutters \n      class=\"pt-8\"\n      align=\"center\"\n      justify=\"center\">\n      <h1 class=\"text-h4 font-weight-thin mb-4\">\n              Tutorial Program\n      </h1>\n    </v-row>\n    <v-row \n      class=\"pb-8 pr-8 pl-8\"\n      align=\"center\"\n      justify=\"center\"\n      no-gutters>\n      <v-timeline>\n        <v-timeline-item\n          v-for=\"(item, i) in programItems\"\n          :key=\"i\"\n          :color=\"item.color\"\n          small\n        >\n          <template v-slot:opposite>\n            <span\n              :class=\"`headline font-weight-bold ${item.color}--text`\"\n              v-text=\"item.time\"\n            ></span>\n          </template>\n          <div class=\"py-4\">\n            <h2 :class=\"`headline font-weight-light mb-4 ${item.color}--text`\">\n              {{item.title}}\n            </h2>\n            <div>\n              {{item.description}}\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </v-timeline-item>\n      </v-timeline>\n    </v-row>\n  </v-container>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport BiographyCard from './BiographyCard.vue'\n\n  export default {\n  components: { \n    BiographyCard\n    },\n    name: 'LandingPage',\n\n    data: () => ({\n      authors: [\n        {\n          name: 'Ruwan Wickramarachchi', \n          imagePath: 'Ruwan.jpeg',\n          company: 'AI Institute - University of South Carolina', \n          logo_path: '', \n          biography: 'Ruwan Wickramarachchi is a Ph.D. student at the AI Institute, University of South Carolina.
