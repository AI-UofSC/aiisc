In this tutorial, we will examine the use of knowledge-infused learning for three core state-of-the-art technical achievements within the AD domain.

To manage these vast amounts of data, companies are beginning to experiment with the use of KGs, which are capable of representing meaningful relations between entities in the world while helping to enable the principles of FAIR data – i.e. findability, accessibility, interoperability, and re-use. Simultaneously, current research into the emerging topic of <b>knowledge-infused learning  [1] -- or more generally, neuro-symbolic AI </b>, which is often dubbed as the <b> 3rd wave of AI [2]</b> -- is showing new and exciting uses for KGs in AI applications.  Knowledge-infused learning proposes intuitive ways of leveraging knowledge graphs within machine/deep learning solutions. This infusion of knowledge has been shown to improve the predictive capabilities of ML/DL while providing great potential for improving interpretability, explainability, robustness, and transferability. For these reasons, knowledge-infused learning holds much promise for helping to meet the complex technical challenges of autonomous driving (AD). In this tutorial, we will focus on three distinct technical innovations that leverage knowledge-infused learning. \n  </p>\n    </v-row>\n\n\n <v-row no-gutters \n      class=\"pt-8\"\n      align=\"center\"\n      justify=\"center\">\n      <h1 class=\"text-h4 font-weight-thin mb-4\">\n              Detailed Description\n      </h1>\n    </v-row>\n      <v-row no-gutters\n      class=\"pa-8\"\n      align=\"center\"\n      justify=\"center\">\n      <p class=\"text-justify\">\nWe seek to provide an overview of knowledge-infused learning, an examination of its use for autonomous driving, and three deep dives into current state-of-the-art technical achievements. Specifically, the tutorial will consist of 5 interconnected lecture modules; two 30 mins introductory modules followed by three 40 mins modules for each application. The audience is expected to have a basic understanding of deep/machine learning, semantic technologies (e.g., RDF, OWL, linked open data) and semantic embedding approaches. We aim to guide attendees through a high-level tour of the knowledge-infused learning methods, basic familiarity into open-domain autonomous driving datasets/challenges, and the process of solving domain problems using neuro-symbolic AI methods. We'll be covering the following modules in this tutorial.\n </p>\n <ul>\n   <li><b>Knowledge-infused Learning (KL): </b>  KL a form of neuro-symbolic AI is a novel paradigm that seeks to incorporate a variety of explicit (symbolic) knowledge into a data-driven statistical AI framework that supports advancement in machine intelligence. Utilizing knowledge and data in deep learning models to enable learning from lower-level syntactic and lexical features from data through statistical (deep) learning as well as higher-level concepts from knowledge. Using knowledge also allows greater transparency in the decision-making, and enables explanations that users need for informed decision making. Recently, researchers have categorized the recent approaches into a continuum that comprises of three stages; namely, shallow, semi-deep, and deep infusion. We will provide a detailed overview for each stage of knowledge infusion with examples across several application domains. (<i>See relevant resources:</i> [1])</li><br>\n\n   <li><b>Applications for Autonomous Driving: </b>  Despite recent advancements, AD is still far from ready to meet full level-5 autonomy requirements. The primary obstacle is the <i>open-world</i> environment in which the autonomous vehicle must operate. Navigating this environment requires making informed decisions and taking actions within novel and complex situations. While machine learning, in general, and autonomous driving, in particular, have had much success in <i>closed-world</i> environments with lots of experiential training data, the challenges posed by an open-world environment are yet to be resolved. Additionally, the full autonomy of self-driving and its widespread usage poses a new set of non-technical challenges, including user acceptance, accountability, explainability, and conformance to legal, ethical, and societal boundaries. We believe that knowledge-infused learning -- through an integration of domain knowledge and machine learning -- is a potent tool to overcome such challenges. (<i>See relevant resources:</i> [Ref])</li><br>\n   \n   <li><b>Knowledge-based Entity Prediction (KEP) for Improved Machine Perception: </b> <br clear=”left” /> <img src=\"../assets/kep.png\" align=\"left\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" />Machine perception is one of the key technical problems in AD where detecting and recognizing objects/events in a scene (i.e. environmental perception) is a critical task. This, however, is particularly challenging as there are several reasons why an entity could go unrecognized. This includes, but not limited to, sensor failure, occlusion, low resolution (e.g., from weather), or errors in computer vision models. For example, consider the case where an ego vehicle driving through a residential neighborhood and detects only a ball on the road (partial observation) and could contain unrecognized entities such as \\texttt{Child} in the scene.  Knowledge-based entity prediction (KEP) is a novel task that aims to address this issue by leveraging relational knowledge from heterogeneous sources in predicting potentially unrecognized entities\\cite{wickramarachchi2021knowledge}. We will show how an innovative knowledge-infused learning approach can be developed for KEP and demonstrate its usefulness considering two high-quality, large-scale real AD datasets. (<i>See relevant resources:</i> [Ref])</li><br>\n\n   <li><b>Leveraging Commonsense for Explainable Scene Clustering: </b>  The task of scene clustering refers to clustering a given set of scenes and assigning descriptive label(s) to each cluster. For example, a cluster may be described as <i>accident</i> scenes with a crashed vehicle, a police car, and an ambulance. Using scenes represented in a knowledge graph, and enriched with commonsense knowledge, it may be possible to automatically generate explanations for semantic clusters. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how an innovative approach can be developed for explainable scene clustering along with the process of leveraging relevant commonsense knowledge for this task. (<i>See relevant resources:</i> [1])</li><br>\n\n     <li><b>Learning Visual Models for Road Sign Recognition using a Knowledge Graph as a Trainer </b>   The task of recognizing and understanding road signs is an important feature of autonomous driving. Current technology for road sign recognition (RSR) is mainly based on computer vision (CV) algorithms that solely depend on image data distribution of the training domain. Such models, however, tend to fail when applied to a target domain (e.g., road signs from China) that differs from their source domain (e.g. road signs from Germany) (see Fig. \\ref{fig:roadsigns}). Knowledge graph neural network (KG-NN) is a novel neuro-symbolic approach to address the problem of transfer learning by using image-data-invariant auxiliary knowledge. We will show how this technology can be applied to enable transfer learning for the RSR task.
