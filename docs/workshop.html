<h2 style="color:#d9232d;">Cysoc 2021 - International Workshop on Cyber Social Threats</h2>
<h5 style="margin:3% 0;color:#d9232d;">Co-located with The 15th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM)</h5>
<p>The role of online platforms as a prime, daily communication tool is coincident with a sharp rise in its misuse, threatening our society in large. These platforms have been implicated for promoting hate speech, radicalization, harassment, cyberbullying, fake news, human trafficking, drug dealing, gender-based stereotyping and violence among other ills, with a significant impact on individual and community well-being. Such content and behaviors are inherently multi-faceted, making the recognition of their narratives challenging for researchers as well as social media companies. The implications to individuals and communities require reliable models and algorithms for detecting, understanding and countering the malevolent behavior in such communications. These challenges have led to a rising prominence of analysis of online communications in academia, politics, homeland security, and industry using computational techniques from natural language processing, statistics, network science, data mining, machine learning, computational linguistics, human-computer interaction, and cognitive science. To meet these challenges, this workshop aims to stimulate research on social, cultural, emotional, communicative, and linguistic aspects of harmful conversations on online platforms and developing novel approaches to analyze, interpret and understand them.</p>
<p>The workshop welcomes for consideration papers that employ quantitative and/or qualitative, analytical, theoretical approaches examining a diverse range of issues related to online harmful communications. Papers on resources/data and tools will also be welcome either for demos or for short/regular talks.</p>

<h2 style="color:#d9232d;">Emoji2021 - 4thâ€‹ International Workshop on Emoji Understanding and Applications in Social Media </h2>
<h5 style="margin:3% 0;color:#d9232d;">Co-located with The 15th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM)</h5>
<p>Pictographs, commonly referred to as "emoji", have become a popular way to enhance electronic communication. With their introduction in the late 1990's, emoji have been widely used to enhance the sentiment, emotion, and sarcasm expressed in social media messages. They often play distinct social and communicative roles compared to other forms of written language while taking over language constructs such as slang terms and emoticons. The ability to automatically process, derive meaning and interpret text fused with emoji will be essential as society embraces emoji as a standard form of online communication. Yet the pictorial nature of emoji, the fact that (the same) emoji may be used in different contexts to express different meanings, and that emoji are used in different cultures and communities over the world who interpret emoji differently, make it especially difficult to apply traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze them. To meet these challenges, Emoji aims to stimulate research on understanding social, cultural, communicative, and linguistic roles of emoji and developing novel computational approaches to analyze, interpret and understand emoji and their usage in social media applications. It will provide a forum to bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry in the areas of computer science, social network analysis and mining, natural language processing, computational linguistics, human-computer interaction, and computational social sciences to discuss high-quality research and emerging applications, to exchange ideas and experience, and to identify new opportunities for collaboration.</p>
<p>Emoji is the 4th of a series of emoji understanding workshops conducted by the organizers. The 1st emoji understanding workshop, Emoji, was the best-attended workshop at ICWSM 2018 (with 35 attendees) that was extended from a half-day to a full-day due to the quality and quantity of submissions received and the expressed interest. It attracted 18 submissions, including 14 long papers and 4 short papers. A total of 8 papers (6 long papers and 2 short papers) were accepted for the final workshop program and it also included a keynote presentation, a tutorial, and a highly interdisciplinary panel on "The Challenges in Emoji Understanding" that provided an animated and engaging forum to the attendees to discuss the open emoji research problems with leading researchers and practitioners. The workshop program was covered in a WIRED.com article which can be accessed online at https://www.wired.com/story/academic-emoji-conference/. The second emoji understanding workshop, Emoji, was co-located with The Web Conference 2019 (formerly, The World Wide Web Conference). It attracted 11 submissions, including 7 full papers and 4 short papers, out of which, 6 papers were accepted for presentation. The workshop program also consisted of a keynote presentation and three invited talks. The workshop ran for a half-day and attracted more than 40 participants. The third emoji understanding workshop, Emoji, was co-located with ICWSM 2020. It attracted 63 registered participants where Emojination and Adobe Inc. sponsored twenty of them with their workshop registration fees. The workshop program consisted of a keynote speech, an invited talk, and five research paper presentations. To minimize the effect of not having an opportunity to network in-person due to the online nature of this workshop, an hour long virtual networking event was conducted at the end of the workshop which attracted lively participation.</p>

<h2 style="color:#d9232d;">KiL KGC 2021</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>This workshop will bring researchers in academia, industry, humanitarian organizations, and healthcare practioners ar the confluence of knowledge representation, natural language understanding, and deep learning. Prior exposure to the basic concepts in NLP and DL is desirable, however, there are no prerequisites for attending the tutorial. We will cover basics and advanced techniques with sufficient use cases and demonstrations. Newcomers in the area will learn the basic principles of data science and the fundamentals of knowledge-infused learning. Expert attendees will appreciate promising, reliable, and practical approaches to overcoming familiar technical obstacles in social good domains.</p>

<h2 style="color:#d9232d;">KDD KiML 2020 - Co-located with 26th ACM SIGKDD</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>Research in artificial intelligence and data science is accelerating rapidly due to an unprecedented explosion in the amount of information on the web. In parallel, we noticed immense growth in the construction and utility of the knowledge network from Google, Netflix, NSF, and NIH.</p>
<p>However, current methods risk an unsatisfactory ceiling of applicability due to shortcomings in bringing homogeneity between knowledge graphs, data mining, and deep learning. In this changing world, retrospective studies for building state-of-the-art AI and Data science systems have raised concerns on trust, traceability, and interactivity for prospective applications in healthcare, finance, and crisis response.</p>
<p>We believe the paradigm of knowledge-infused mining and learning would account for both pieces of knowledge that accrue from domain expertise and guidance from physical models. Further, it will allow the community to design new evaluation strategies that assess robustness and fairness across all comparable state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>
