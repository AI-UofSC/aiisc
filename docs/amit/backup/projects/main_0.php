				<strong>eDarkTrends: Monitoring Cryptomarkets to Identify Emerging Trends of Illicit Synthetic Opioids Use:</strong>
				<br>
				The overall purposes of the proposed study are to (a) characterize illicit synthetic opioid marketing characteristics and trends, and (b) identify new, emerging illicit synthetic opioid terms (e.g., substance names, product forms) from three "cryptomarkets" located in the Deep Web. The Specific Aims of the study are to: 1) Develop a semi-automated knowledge-based system, eDarkTrends, to collect and process data about illicit synthetic opioids supplied on cryptomarkets; 2a) Describe and monitor US-based supply trends of illicit synthetic opioids on cryptomarkets (e.g., trends in availability of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl analogs, U-47700, MT-45), including types of illicit synthetic opioids, prices, advertised purity, dosage and product forms, quantity supplied, and drug combinations; 2b) Identify new illicit synthetic opioid substances and product forms soon after they appear on cryptomarkets.

				Asthma affects over 300 million people, claiming over 250,000 worldwide annually. Using low cost sensors and an intelligent mobile application, this research will develop algorithms and techniques to empower patients and doctors by providing personalized, contextually-relevant, and actionable information synthesized from a comprehensive understanding of health-relevant data.  The proposed research will uncover correlations among extracted sensor features, their relationship to the control and severity of asthma, and will personalize management of asthma.

				<strong>Maximizing the Collective Intelligence of a Network Using Novel Measures of Socio-Cognitive Diversity:</strong>
				<br>
				We will explore the degree to which it is possible to augment “wisdom of crowd” effects by developing novel, theory-based measures of socio-cognitive diversity and using them to select smaller, smarter sub-crowds. Socio-cognitive diversity refers to differences in individuals’ prior beliefs and information sources, including information acquired through social interaction. We will consider the case of networked crowds in particular–that is, groups of communicating individuals who share information in the process of arriving at a judgment (for example, a group of military intelligence analysts who work together to predict the location of a high-value target). We focus on networks because (a) real-world analysis and decision-making typically involve some degree of collaboration; (b) communications among members (i.e., who said what to whom) constitute a rich data source from which measures of diversity can potentially be extracted using automated methods.

					In this project the team will design novel, multi-dimensional cross-modal aggregation and inference methods to compensate for the uneven coverage of sensing modalities across an affected region. By assimilating data from social and physical sensors and their integrated modeling and analysis, methodology to predict and help prioritize the temporally and conceptually extended consequences of damage to people, civil infrastructure (transportation, power, waterways) and their components (e.g. bridges, traffic signals) will be designed. The team will also develop innovative technology to support the identification of new background knowledge and structured data to improve object extraction, location identification, correlation or integration of relevant data across multiple sources and modalities (social, physical and Web). Novel coupling of socio-linguistic and network analysis will be used to identify important persons and objects, statistical and factual knowledge about traffic and transportation networks, and their impact on hazard models (e.g. storm surge) and flood mapping. Domain-grounded mechanisms will be developed to address pervasive trustworthiness and reliability concerns. Exemplar outcomes are expected to include specific tools for first-responders as well as recovery teams to aid in the prioritization of relief and repair efforts, leveraging improved flood response, urban mapping, and dynamic storm surge models, and interdisciplinary training of students leveraging research in pedagogy, in conjunction with Ohio State University’s new undergraduate major in data analytics, and Wright State University’s Big and Smart Data graduate certificate program.

					This project plans to further develop a comprehensive platform to compute Collective Social Intelligence from social media data. It currently uses Twitter as a starting point, and brings in news, multimedia, Wikipedia, and Linked Open Data as complementary data/background knowledge for analysis. Its detailed analysis encompasses the spatio-temporal-thematic (where, when, what), people-content-networking (who and how), and emotion-sentiment-intent (perceptions &amp; impact) domains. Given that social media is predominately used as a means of delivering messages, this technology is designed to gain insights and predict trends using data gathered from social media. Additionally, it plans to support transitioning research on advanced social media analysis techniques and early state technology into real world products and services to help improve the quality of information available to decision-makers and their products.

					With the collaboration of AFRL/RX, the Kno.e.sis Center is introducing the materials and process community to better data management practices. A data exchange system will be created that will allow researchers to index, search, and compare data while also enabling a shortened transition cycle in material science, which usually takes 5 to 10 years. This multi-disciplinary project will develop material ontologies that establish a common vocabulary and the associated tools to manipulate the structured/unstructured corpus. These ontologies focus primarily on an in-depth biomaterials ontology and a broader materials research ontology. We will also illustrate the use of the ontology we create to semantically search for relevant KDDM biomaterials information quickly. Datasets and software developed as part of this project will be made available to the broader research community in material science.

					<br>
					This project develops exploratory techniques to richly interlink components of LOD and then addresses the challenge of querying the LOD cloud, i.e., of obtaining answers to questions which require accessing, retrieving and combining information from different parts of the LOD cloud. Techniques for overcoming semantic heterogeneity include: semantic enrichment through Wikipedia bootstrapping; semantic integration through abstraction by means of upper-level ontologies; and, massively parallel methods for tractable ontology reasoning. Specifically, this research will: (1) identify richer, broader, and more relevant relationships between LOD datasets at instance and schema level (these relationships will promote better knowledge discovery, querying, and mapping of ontologies); (2) realize LOD query federation through an upper level ontology; and, (3) enable access to implicit knowledge through ontology reasoning.

This is done in a way so that humans are presented with highly relevant information at a level of abstractions that lends itself to better and more timely decision-making. While many  efforts in semantic sensor web and semantic social web show promise in this area, it is critical that trustworthiness of observational data as well as reported information at higher level abstraction be an integral part of any system that is of value to military decision makers.

Instead of relying on traditional epidemiological surveillance methods such as population surveys or face-to-face interviews with drug-involved individuals, PREDOSE focuses on the web, which provides venues for individuals to freely share their experiences, post questions, and offer comments about different drugs. Such User-Generated Content (UGC) can be used as a very rich source of unsolicited, unfiltered, and anonymous self-disclosures of drug use behaviors. The automatic extraction of such data enables qualitative researchers to overcome scalability limitations imposed by existing methods of qualitative studies.

					This exploratory research develops of new methods for modeling and querying spatial, temporal and thematic (STT) data. The methods differ significantly from traditional approaches for STT data management; they follow a paradigm that goes beyond querying for resources to querying about the relationships between resources. Three STT data management advances this will lead to are: (1) new query operators that exploit the graph-centric nature of Semantic Web data models, (2) new indexing and query processing techniques for STT data that are specialized for Semantic Web data models and (3) an extension of the SPARQL RDF query language to support STT queries.

					Trust and confidence are becoming key issues in diverse applications such as ecommerce, social networks, semantic sensor web, semantic web information retrieval systems, etc. Both humans and machines use some form of trust to make informed and reliable decisions before acting. In this work, we briefly review existing work on trust networks, pointing out some of its drawbacks. We then propose a local framework to explore two different kinds of trust among agents called referral trust and functional trust that are modeled using local partial orders, to enable qualitative trust personalization. The proposed approach formalizes reasoning with trust, distinguishing between direct and inferred trust. It is also capable of dealing with general trust networks with cycles.

					<strong>Chatter, Intent, Good Karma, and Contextual Advertisements in Social Networks:</strong>
					<br>
					Advertising approaches to monetizing user content on social networking sites (SNSs) are profile-based contextual advertisements, demographic-based ads, or a combination of the two. Content-based or contextual ads are generated by automatically finding relevant keywords on a network page and displaying ads based on those keywords. Such advertising on SNSs uses information—such as interests and activities—on member profiles for delivering ads. While profile information might be useful for launching product campaigns and micro-targeting customers, it does not necessarily contain current user interests or purchase intents. Ads generated from such content are inherently less relevant to a user. Over time, this leads to a scenario where ad campaigns see several ad impressions but very few click-throughs. The proposed research will exploit user activity on public venues (such as forums, marketplaces, and groups) on SNSs in addition to their profile information for generating ads on user profiles. The core components of the research is identifying monetizable user activity on SNSs, observing user response behaviors, and extracting keywords and phrases in user posts while eliminating off-topic chatter.

					The role of information technology (IT) is recognized to be a critical component in the effort of improving national security, including homeland defense. Applications of importance to national security, such as aviation security, pose significant challenges to current information technology and provide excellent source for further research in developing next generation IT solutions. 	Recently, there is significant advance in applying techniques from database and information systems, knowledge representation, AI, information retrieval including text categorization, lexical and language analysis and others in developing a new generation of semantic technologies. Semantic technologies help in associating meaning of data and in more meaningfully organizing data, in meaningfully correlating data, as well as in converting data into information for more effective decision making and in finding information that contextually relevant to users' needs. They help with syntactic and representational as well as semantic interoperability. This general area of research is also getting renewed attention now that there is considerable excitement in the vision of the Semantic Web, characterized as the next phase of the Web.

					<strong>Extending METEOR with Workflow Reuse, Adaptation, and Collaboration:</strong>
					<br>
					Today, companies – large and small – can select Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs) to support their business processes. When processes are critical, it is fundamental that WfMS infrastructures continue to provide pre-established service levels to users in the face of disruptions. Adaptation addresses precisely this issue. Current architectures do not incorporate adequate solutions that enhance WfMSs’ adaptation. In this paper we present a set of comprehensive techniques to be used in the development of WfMSs to increase their level of adaptation. We discuss how workflow adaptation can be triggered, which adaptation strategies can be applied, and why dynamic changes are in-dispensable to carry out adaptation. We not only target adaptation from a functional perspective, but also from an operational perspective. For the strategies presented, we describe their implementation to the METEOR WfMS.

					<strong>Workflow Management for Advanced DOD Applications:</strong>
					<br>
					Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs) are used to support the modeling and coordinated execution of business processes within an organization or across organizational boundaries. Although some research efforts have addressed requirements for authorization and access control for workflow systems, little attention has been paid to the requirements as they apply to application data accessed or managed by WfMSs. In this paper, we discuss key access control requirements for application data in workflow applications using examples from the healthcare domain, introduce a classification of application data used in workflow systems by analyzing their sources, and then propose a comprehensive data authorization and access control mechanism for WfMSs.  This involves four aspects: role, task, process instance-based user group, and data content. For implementation, a predicate-based access control method is used. We believe that the proposed model is applicable to workflow applications and WfMSs with diverse access control requirements.

					<br>
						The growth of Web services and service oriented architecture (SOA) offers attractive basis for realizing dynamic architectures, which mirror the dynamic and ever changing business environment. With the help of industry wide acceptance of standards like Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS), Web Service Description Language (WSDL) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Web Services offer the potential of low cost and immediate integration with other applications and partners. The METEOR-S project at the LSDIS Lab, University of Georgia aims to extend these standards with Semantic Web technologies to achieve greater dynamism and scalability. Specifically, [Verma et al., 2004a; Sivashanmugam et al., 2003] focus on adding semantics to WSDL and UDDI (this work termed WSDL-S is being provided as input for next version of WSDL that will support semantic representation), [Verma et al., 2004b; Sivashanmugan et al., 2004] focus on adding semantics to BPEL4WS, and [Patil et al., 2004] discusses a semi-automatic approach for annotating Web services described using WSDL.

					<br>
					The LSDIS lab's collaborative research project on Active Semantic Electronic Patient Record with the <a href="http:www.athensheartcenter.com/">Athens Heart Center</a> (AHC) exemplifies an implementation of ASDs in a healthcare (more specifically cardiology practice) environment. It has so far involved: (1) the development of populated ontologies in the healthcare (specially cardiology practice) domain; (2) the development of an annotation tool that utilizes the developed ontologies for annotation of patient records, and (3) the development of decision support algorithms that support rule and ontology based checking/validation and evaluation. The most important benefit we seek from ASEMR (with its proactive semantic annotations and rule-based evaluation) is (1) the reduction of medical errors that could occur as an oversight, (2) checks such as preferred drug recommendations lead to prescription drug savings for patients leading to improved satisfaction, and (3) assistance in choosing the medically appropriate ICD-9 code could lead to less communications with the insurer and faster payment.

					<strong>Model Generation and Model Extension for Information and Knowledge Management:</strong>

					For this proposal three main points were identified: 1) Building a domain model based on the users interest; 2) Identifying a concept descriptions vs. concept mentions in text; 3) Focused search and browse guidance. The work on Domain Taxonomy creation was mostly finished prior to the project start. However, for the purpose of finding inter-entity relationships, the researchers found it useful to create more entity-heavy models than were created in Doozer or Taxonom.com. For this reason we modified Doozer to explore more Wikipedia pages and cut fewer of them, if there was still enough evidence that they were in the desired domain.

					<strong>HP Live Information Management:</strong>
					<br>
					We propose a framework that, either visibly or invisibly to the user, allows guided search and browsing as well as classification and selection of information to improve information processing and knowledge sharing. For this, we identify three main requirements: 1) a domain model based on the user's interest, automatically generated on the basis of a simple domain description, 2) identification of concept descriptions vs. concept mentions in text, and 3) a focused search with browsing guidance. User interest is highly individual, so the more focused it is on a particular area of interest, the less likely a generic model will match any given user. Still, many topics of interest are based on well-known concepts described on some Web pages, often on collaboratively authored content such as Wikipedia. When we can identify by user behavior or explicit queries that correspond to the Wikipedia concepts of interest to individual users, we can carve out a part of Wikipedia (a form of relevant collective intelligence) that reflect their current interest. This is a form of blended semantic search and browsing that takes our past efforts into personalized form while leveraging collective intelligence.
