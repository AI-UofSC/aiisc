		<strong>Towards Commercialization of Twitris&mdash;A System of Collective Intelligence:</strong>
		<br>
		This project plans to further develop a comprehensive platform to compute Collective Social Intelligence from social media data. It currently uses Twitter as a starting point, and brings in news, multimedia, Wikipedia, and Linked Open Data as complementary data/background knowledge for analysis. Its detailed analysis encompasses the spatio-temporal-thematic (where, when, what), people-content-networking (who and how), and emotion-sentiment-intent (perceptions & impact) domains. Given that social media is predominately used as a means of delivering messages, this technology is designed to gain insights and predict trends using data gathered from social media. Additionally, it plans to support transitioning research on advanced social media analysis techniques and early state technology into real world products and services to help improve the quality of information available to decision-makers and their products.

		<strong>Materials Database Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining:</strong>
		<br>
		With the collaboration of AFRL/RX , the Kno.e.sis Center is introducing the materials and process community to better data management practices. A data exchange system will be created that will allow researchers to index, search, and compare data and will also enable a shortened transition cycle in material science, which usually takes 5 to 10 years. This multi-disciplinary project will develop materials ontologies that establish a common vocabulary and the associated tools to manipulate the structured/unstructured corpus. These ontologies will focused in-depth biomaterials ontology and broader materials research ontology. We will also illustrate the use of the ontology we create to semantically search for relevant KDDM biomaterials information quickly. Datasets and software developed as part of this project will be made available to the broader research community in material science.

		<strong>METEOR-S: Semantic Web Services and Processes:</strong>
		<br>
		The growth of Web services and service oriented architecture (SOA) offers attractive basis for realizing dynamic architectures, which mirror the dynamic and ever changing business environment. With the help of industry wide acceptance of standards like Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS), Web Service Description Language (WSDL) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Web Services offer the potential of low cost and immediate integration with other applications and partners. The METEOR-S project at the LSDIS Lab, University of Georgia aims to extend these standards with Semantic Web technologies to achieve greater dynamism and scalability. Specifically, [Verma et al., 2004a; Sivashanmugam et al., 2003] focus on adding semantics to WSDL and UDDI (this work termed WSDL-S is being provided as input for next version of WSDL that will support semantic representation), [Verma et al., 2004b; Sivashanmugan et al., 2004] focus on adding semantics to BPEL4WS, and [Patil et al., 2004] discusses a semi-automatic approach for annotating Web services described using WSDL.

		<strong>SAI (Association Identification and Knowledge Discovery for National Security Applications):</strong>
		<br>
		The role of information technology (IT) is recognized to be a critical component in the effort of improving national security, including homeland defense. Applications of importance to national security, such as aviation security, pose significant challenges to current information technology and provide excellent source for further research in developing next generation IT solutions. 	Recently, there is significant advance in applying techniques from database and information systems, knowledge representation, AI, information retrieval including text categorization, lexical and language analysis and others in developing a new generation of semantic technologies. Semantic technologies help in associating meaning of data and in more meaningfully organizing data, in meaningfully correlating data, as well as in converting data into information for more effective decision making and in finding information that contextually relevant to users' needs. They help with syntactic and representational as well as semantic interoperability. This general area of research is also getting renewed attention now that there is considerable excitement in the vision of the Semantic Web, characterized as the next phase of the Web.

		<strong>ASD (Active Semantic Documents):</strong>
		<br>
		The LSDIS lab's collaborative research project on Active Semantic Electronic Patient Record with the	<a href="http://www.athensheartcenter.com/">Athens Heart Center</a> (AHC) exemplifies an implementation of ASDs in a healthcare (more specifically cardiology practice) environment. It has so far involved: (1) the development of populated ontologies in the healthcare (specially cardiology practice) domain; (2) the development of an annotation tool that utilizes the developed ontologies for annotation of patient records, and (3) the development of decision support algorithms that support rule and ontology based checking/validation and evaluation. The most important benefit we seek from ASEMR (with its proactive semantic annotations and rule-based evaluation) is (1) the reduction of medical errors that could occur as an oversight, (2) checks such as preferred drug recommendations lead to prescription drug savings for patients leading to improved satisfaction, and (3) assistance in choosing the medically appropriate ICD-9 code could lead to less communications with the insurer and faster payment.
