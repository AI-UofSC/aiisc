<p><a href="mailto:amit@cs.uga.edu"><b><font size="2">Dr. Amit Sheth</font></b></a><font size="2"> is 
an </font> <font size="2"><b>Educator, Entrepreneur, and Researchers.&nbsp; </b>He is an IEEE Fellow. He enjoys mixing activities that span from conceptual research to <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>entrepreneurship </span>involving commercial
products and real-world applications.&nbsp; He is a Professor of
Computer Science and the director of the <a href="http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu/">Large
Scale Distributed Information Systems (LSDIS) Lab</a>, at the <a
href="http://www.uga.edu/">University of Georgia</a>.&nbsp; He is also<b> </b></font><font size="2">
the CTO and co-founder of Semagix, Inc. </font> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Dr. Sheth’s research is in the Database and 
Information Systems area of the Computer Science.&nbsp; Because most applications 
depend on information that is distributed, such as on the Web or in multiple 
databases in an enterprise, information integration and workflow management for 
coordination of distributed activities have been at a forefront of research in 
database and information systems for the last three decades.&nbsp; Over the last 
decade, more formal approaches to associate semantics (meaning and 
understanding) of data and applications have emerged as one of the most vibrant 
areas of emphasis in the research in this area.&nbsp; Within this context, Dr. 
Sheth’s work has primarily concentrated in the following subareas:</font></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in" type="disc">
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Heterogeneous Databases: multi-database 
  or federated database systems architecture, schema and view integration, 
  multi-database transactions, multi-database consistency and data quality;</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Workflow management;  Semantic and Autonomic Web 
  Services and Processes: workflow modeling involving heterogeneous user and 
  system tasks; formal workflow scheduling; transactional workflows; dynamic/adaptive and scalable workflow management; </font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Semantic Web including core issues of 
  semantics of information: semantic heterogeneity; comprehensive use of 
  metadata (syntactic, structural, semantic) for digital media (textual and 
  non-textual) integration; semantic proximity and use of content; 
  ontology-driven heterogeneous content integration; multi-ontology query 
  processing; semantic metadata extraction; semantic annotation; semantic enabled networking; semantic graph mining; RDF graph mining; semantic visualization; virtual 3D interfaces on semantic web; </font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Semantic and Autonomic Web Processes: specification of semantic web services (WSDL-S), execution environments, <font size="2">comprehensive role of semantics in Web process encompassing data, function, non-functional semantics and <font size="2"> execution; autonomic features for services and processes; semantics enabled light-weight services. </font></font></font></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Dr. Sheth has also conducted extensive 
multi-disciplinary research involving bioinformatics, health care, financial 
services, homeland and national security and geographic information systems.&nbsp; He is a faculty member of the Institute of Bioinformatics (UGA), Biomedical Health Science Institute (UGA), Faculty of Engineering (UGA) and UCGIS. </font></p>

<p><b><font size="2" color="#FF8000">As an Educator </font></b></p>

<p><font size="2">Prof. Sheth jointed the UGA and started the LSDIS lab in 1994.
His educational activities have
included introduction of  innovative courses on Semantic Web, Semantic Web Services &amp; Processes, Semantic
Enterprise, Enterprise Integration and
Global Information Systems.&nbsp; These courses combine latest academic research
with commercial state of the art research, as well as conceptual frameworks to hands on projects with practical applications.&nbsp; He
was also involved in developing an interdisciplinary program in Masters of
Internet Technology and has been on the steering committee of New Media
Institute at UGA. &nbsp; His favorite accomplishment is </font><strong>
<font size="2"><span style="layout-grid-mode: line; font-weight: normal">the UGA
Career Center Recognition/Award for “<i>greatly contributing to the career
development of UGA students</i>.”</span></font><span style="layout-grid-mode: line; font-weight: normal"><font size="2">
His guiding philosophy for advising graduate advisees is &quot;learning how to learn.&quot;&nbsp;

</font></span><span style="font-weight: normal; layout-grid-mode: line">
<font size="2">Additional thoughts on teaching appears in this 2003

<p><b><font size="2" color="#FF8000">As an Entrepreneur</font></b></p>

<p><font size="2">In August 1999, Sheth founded Taalee,
Inc., a Venture Capital funded enterprise software and internet infrastructure
startup based on the technology developed at the LSDIS lab.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He managed Taalee as its CEO until June 2001.&nbsp;
After Taalee was acquired by <span class="SpellE">Voquette</span>, Inc and subsequently 
merged with Protégé Holdings to become Semangix, Inc., <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>he has been the CTO/co-Founder for Voquette, Inc. and
Semagix. </span>He has also founded another high-tech company&#8212;<span
class=SpellE>Infocosm</span>, Inc, which commercialized workflow technology. He has provided consulting to a wide variety
of companies involving real world solutions to the real world problems. His
research has led to several commercial products and applications (including AdaptX/Harness from Bellcore based on InfoHarness project, METEOR EAppS from
Infocosm based on the METEOR project, and Freedom from <font color="#808080">
<a href="http://www.semagix.com/">Semagix</a></font> or Semantic Engine from
Taalee based on SCORE technology and VideoAnywhere project), as well as two
patents (<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=/netahtml/search-adv.htm&r=1&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=ft00&S1=Sheth-Amit.INZZ.&OS=IN/Sheth-Amit&RS=IN/Sheth-Amit">6,311,194</a>,
