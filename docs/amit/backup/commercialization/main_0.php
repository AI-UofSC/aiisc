From ideas and research to real-world: applications, deployed systems, and commercial products/services.

In most of my activities, I seek to traverse the entire innovation cycle. This may start with conceiving ideas while walking and brainstorming with students or partners, then lead to a series of activities that typically involve:


<ul>
	<li>
		Bringing resources (which usually takes the form of writing proposals);
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Leading and supervising efforts involving training, team building and prototype building;
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Understanding users and customers, or partners in our interdisciplinary research;
	</li>
	
	<li>
		System building (which often lends itself to an open source tool(s) and datasets, licensed technologies and patents, operationally deployed
		applications and software, or commercial products and services).
	</li>
</ul>

Below is a brief, <u>incomplete</u> list of some of my <strong>activities that have gone from industry or academic research to the real world</strong>. I would be remiss not to point out that these activities are almost always a team effort. When in industry, I had colleagues, and in academia, I have my graduate students. I have attempted to point out some of the key contributors and partners, but my memory may not be perfect as I look back over two decades (co-authors of cited publication indicate more contributors).
