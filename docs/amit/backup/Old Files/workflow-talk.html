<P>Recent trends, especially the move towards managed care, has put significant
additional demands on Healthcare businesses.&nbsp; Key among
<BR>these are support for internal auditing and compulsory performance
reporting, and reducing the cost of delivery, while at the same time
<BR>maintaining or reducing the cost of operations and improving the quality
of care.&nbsp; An important requirement for meeting these needs is
<BR>to significantly improve the processes through coordination of multiple
personnel and information systems that are spread over
<BR>multiple organizations in an enterprise as well as across multiple
enterprises.&nbsp; A good workflow technology has the potential to make
<BR>this happen.

<P>However, in spite of significant hype, current workflow products generally
fall short in meeting requirements of complex applications.
<BR>One of the key objectives of the Healthcare Information Infrastructure
Technology (HIIT) project is to develop a workflow automation
<BR>technology that is suitable for the needs of healthcare industry, and
more importantly, demonstrate its use.&nbsp; In HIIT, the Large Scale
<BR>Distributed Information Systems Lab at the University of Georgia (UGA)
is pushing the state-of-the-art in the workflow automation technology
<BR>by supporting two key features:

<P>(a) supporting high-level graphical design of workflows involving both
human and computerized activities,
<BR>and their mostly automatic translation to executable code, and
<BR>(b) ability to support realistic environments consisting of multiple
infrastructures involving internet/World-Wide-Web, distributed object
<BR>management (CORBA), Lotus Notes, and wireless technologies, with appropriate
support for recovery, failure-handling, auditing, data
<BR>consistency, and security.

<P>This presentation discusses the Immunization Tracking application and
the role of UGA's workflow technology in an application partnership in
<BR>the Healthcare Enterprise Information Management spoke of HIIT.&nbsp;
This partnership involving Connecticut Healthcare Education and Research
<BR>Foundation (CHREF), UGA, and Microelectronics and Computer Technology
Corporation (MCC).&nbsp; The clinical aspects of the application involves
<BR>creating and maintaining immunization records for children in hospitals
or clinics and updating centralized patient records.&nbsp; The tracking
aspect involves using distributed and heterogeneous databases to generate
reminders for parents, and to generate reports for use by state agencies,
Medicaid office, and case workers.&nbsp; The system design is extensible
with respect to additional healthcare functions, participation by additional
organizations, and the use of a variety of
<BR>technologies and standards.&nbsp; Additional information for this work
including publications and presentations can be found at

<P>Dr. Amit Sheth directs the Large Scale Distributed Information Systems
(LSDIS) Lab, is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the
<BR>University of Georgia, and an Adjunct Associate Professor in the College
of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology.&nbsp; Earlier
<BR>he worked for nine years in the R&amp;D labs at Bellcore, Unisys, and
Honeywell.&nbsp; His primary current research interests include transactional
<BR>workflow (project METEOR), management of heterogeneous digital data
and semantic issues in global information systems (project InfoQuilt),
<BR>especially the use of ontologies, contexts and metadata, and semantic
relationships across heterogeneous digital data repositories.

<P>He has led projects on heterogeneous DDBMS, factory information system,
integration of AI-database systems (BrAID), transactional
<BR>workflows (PROMT and METEOR), federated database tools (BERDI and TAILOR),
multidatabase consistency, and data quality (Q-Data).&nbsp; LSDIS
<BR>lab (http://www.cs.uga.edu/LSDIS) maintains very active collaboration
with industry, and has won significant funded projects in the areas of
<BR>interoperable information system and workflow management (under the
Healthcare Information Infrastructure Program awarded by NIST) and
<BR>the InfoHarness system for scalability search of heterogeneous information
(awarded in the Massive Digital Data Systems initiative).

<P>Prof. Sheth has published over 80 papers, given over 50 invited and
colloquia talks and 14 tutorials, and lead two international
<BR>conferences and a workshop as a General/Program (Co-)Chair. Currently,
he is a General (Co-)Chair of the 1st Intl. Conference on
<BR>Interoperable and Cooperative Information Systems and the Program Chair
of the NSF Workshop on Workflow and Process Automation.&nbsp; He is a
<BR>founding member and executive committee member of the Intl. Foundation
on Cooperative Information Systems.&nbsp; He has also served twice as an
<BR>ACM Lecturer, has served on over thirty program and organization committees,
and is on the editorial board of five journals.
