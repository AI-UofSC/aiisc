InfoHarness <FONT SIZE=+1>(1993-1996)</FONT></H1>
Enormous amounts of heterogeneous information have been accumulated within
organizations. It has become quite easy to create new information, but
the knowledge about the existence, location, and means of retrieval of
information has become confusing and is a significant deterrent to effective
utilization of available data. The InfoHarness system is aimed at providing
rapid access to huge amounts of heterogeneous information from the World-Wide
Web browsers, without reformatting, restructuring, or relocating&nbsp;
heterogeneous data.&nbsp; Thus InfoHarness provides uniform access to files
and textual/semi-structured data of a very large variety (e.g., newsgroups,
MS-WORD, Frame, postscripts, source code, AP news, etc.).&nbsp; The data
may be stored in a repository or is accessible on-line (e.g., NNTP server).&nbsp;

<P>Some of the research in this project was commercialized as the AdaptX
Harness platform, system and related services from Bellcore (Bell Communications
Research Inc.)&nbsp; InfoHarness is a trademark of Bellcore.&nbsp;

Use of <B>multiple third party </B>indexing engines.</LI>

<B>Logical structuring of the information space</B> without restructuring,
reformatting or relocating the original information enabling access to

Scalability by<B> combining results</B> from two independently indexed

Scalability through use of <B>multiple InfoHarness servers</B>, and CORBA
based access of data accessible through remove InfoHarness server.</LI>
</UL>
One private industry funded (hence unpublished) extension of the InfoHarness
system has been to provide Web-based browsing, querying and logical restructuring
of data stored in relational databases, in addition to the access to heterogeneous
textual data sources.

The VisualHarness system adds ability to access image data repositories
to the InfoHarness system. It consists of extending the InfoHarness system
with ZEBRA image access systems. The&nbsp; ZEBRA system demonstrates three
features.&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
It is <B><I>customizable:</I></B> ZEBRA supports keyword, attribute and
content based searching, where the user can specify relative weights of
the three search strategies as well as features within the content (e.g.,
image features of color, composition, texture, structure).</LI>

<LI>
It is <B><I>extensible</I></B>: New metadata can be added and the corresponding
access can be supported. Also, different Visual Information Retrieval (VIR)
engines and third party indexing technologies to be hooked into the system&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
It is <B><I>federated</I></B>: It supports access to distributed, autonomous
and heterogeneous data repositories.&nbsp;</LI>
</UL>
A key idea behind the ZEBRA system is to form a combination of these three&nbsp;
different access strategies to achieve better quality results. One interesting
technique developed is the black box approach for extracting the required
information from the VIR engine in the form we could access (distance metrics),
without knowing the internals of the VIR engine. We have shown the validity
of this black box approach by comparing the results obtained with this
approach against the results obtained from a VIR engine.&nbsp;
