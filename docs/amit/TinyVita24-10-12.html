<b>Prof. Amit Sheth </b> (<a href="http://knoesis.org/amit">http://knoesis.org/amit</a>) is an educator, researcher, and entrepreneur. He is the LexisNexis Eminent Scholar and founder/executive director of the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (<a href="http://knoesis.org">Kno.e.sis</a>) at Wright State University. Kno.e.sis conducts research in social/sensor/semantic data and Web 3.0 with real-world applications and multidisciplinary solutions for translational research, healthcare and life sciences, cognitive science, material sciences, clinical (mHealth/dHealth) applications and others. Kno.e.sis' activities have resulted in Wright State University being recognized as a <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzeJBtSxi0Jic3A0UXc1ejVySDQ/edit?pli=1">top organization in the world on World Wide Web</a> in research impact. Prof. Sheth is one of top authors in Computer Science, World Wide Web, and databases (cf: <a href="http://academic.research.microsoft.com/RankList?entitytype=2&topdomainid=2&subdomainid=15&last=10">Microsoft Academic Search</a>; <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2T3H4ekAAAAJ">Google Scholar H-index=87</a>). His <a href="http://knoesis.org/amit/students/">PhD and MS advisees</a> have been exceptionally successful, both in their accomplishments during studies and in their chosen careers.  His research has led to several commercial products, many real-world applications, and two earlier companies with two more in early stages of development. One of these was Taalee/Voquette/Semagix, which was likely the first company (founded in 1999) that developed Semantic Web enabled search and analysis, and semantic application development platforms.
