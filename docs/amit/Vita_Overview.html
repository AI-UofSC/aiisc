recognize the strategic importance of database interoperability and the
architectural principles of database federation. His insights in the late 80s
and early 90s raised issues key to the integration of enterprise and Web data
sources for business, scientific, and defense intelligence applications. The
cumulative results of his innovative, multidisciplinary research and technology
development include significant applications in health care, biomedical
research, defense intelligence, financial services, telecommunication, and GIS.
Not only he is among the best cited authors in computer science, his research
has led to two successful companies, a number of commercial products from large

In the early 1990s, he initiated research in the formal modeling, scheduling,
and correctness of workflows. His METEOR project demonstrated the value of
research with real-world applications; its tools were used in graduate courses
in several countries, and its technology was licensed to create a commercial
product. The follow-on METEOR-S project has been highly influential. He led
research (later joined by IBM) that resulted in the W3C submission of WSDL-S,
the basis for SAWSDL, developed by a Working Group in which he and his team
actively participated and now a W3C recommendation. He currently guides the
development of SA-REST, which supports <span class=SpellE>microformat</span>-based
annotation of popular <span class=SpellE>RESTful</span> services and <span
class=SpellE>WebAPIs</span>. For both SAWSDL and SA-REST, he has provided
leadership in the community-based process followed by W3C. He coauthored a 1995
paper in the journal <i>Distributed &amp; Parallel Databases</i> (Springer)that
is the most cited paper in the workflow management literature, with more than
1200 citations, as well as the most cited among over 430 papers published in
that journal. </p>

Semantic Web</b> Prof. <span class=SpellE>Sheth</span> has investigated,
demonstrated, and advocated comprehensive use of metadata. He explored
syntactical, structural, and semantic metadata; recently, he has pioneered
ontology-driven approaches to metadata extraction and semantic analytics. He
was among the first researchers to utilize description logic (DL) based <span
class=SpellE>ontologies</span> for schema and information integration (a decade
before W3C adopted a DL-based ontology representation standard). His work on
multi-ontology query processing includes the most cited paper on the topic
(over 485 citations). In 1996, he introduced the powerful concept of Metadata
Reference Link (MREF) for associating metadata to hypertext that links
documents on the Web, and described an RDF-based realization in 1998, long
before RDF was adopted as a W3C recommendation. </p>

He is a co-inventor on two international patents in workflow transactions and

of the Distributed and Parallel Database Journal (DAPD), and editor of two
Springer book series: Semantic Web and Beyond (with R. Jain) and Advances in

the editorial boards of five journals including IEEE Internet Computing. <br>
<br>
Prof. <span class=SpellE>Sheth's</span> students are highly successful. They
have been employed in academia (e.g., NCSU), industry (in premier internet and
software companies such as Yahoo!, Microsoft, SAP, SAP Research, and IBM as
well as in startups), and government research labs (e.g., LBNL). A number are
already recognized as leaders in their own right (<span class=SpellE>Vipul</span>
<span class=SpellE>Kashyap</span>, George <span class=SpellE>Cardoso</span>, <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Kunal</span></span> <span class=SpellE>Verma</span>).
<br>
<br>
Prof. <span class=SpellE>Sheth</span> uniquely combines outstanding academic
research credentials and the practical entrepreneurial ability to produce successful
applications to real-world problems from theoretical models. In 1999 he founded
(and led as CEO and as CTO) a Semantic Web technology company, licensing his
research at the LSDIS lab at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Georgia</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, which he
directed. This company (<span class=SpellE>Taalee</span>, later <span
class=SpellE>Voquette/Semagix</span>) was the first to commercialize Semantic
Search on Web for multimodal (audio, video, and text) data. At its acquisition
in 2006, <span class=SpellE>Semagix</span> was a successful company with 35
employees and Fortune 500 customers. Its activities led to over $7 million in
payroll in the economy of <st1:City w:st="on">Athens</st1:City>, <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Georgia</st1:country-region>, before the company moved to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Atlanta</st1:place></st1:City> on its merger.
Innovations demonstrated by <span class=SpellE>Semagix's</span> products
include the ability to create very large <span class=SpellE>ontologies</span>
(populated by millions of assertions) and to extract semantic metadata from
heterogeneous (unstructured, <span class=SpellE>semistructured</span>, and
structured) data. His research and development activities have resulted in
several commercial products and many deployed applications in the areas of
healthcare, biomedical research, financial services, and defense/intelligence.
His leadership resulted in SAWSDL, a W3C recommendation (standard), and <span
class=SpellE>Glyde</span>, a standard for data exchange adopted by the
international research community in complex carbohydrates. <br>
<br>
He received his BE from BITS, <span class=SpellE>Pilani</span>, in 1981 and MS
and PhD from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Ohio</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
in 1983 and 1985, respectively. After an early career in industry R&amp;D (at <span
class=SpellE>Bellcore</span>, Unisys, and Honeywell, 1985&#8211;2004), he
became an academic but took breaks as an entrepreneur to demonstrate the impact
of his research through technology transfer and commercialization. He was
keynote speaker at the first technical meeting organized on Semantic Web (2000)
and has since given many keynote and invited talks on the subject. Several of
his 20-plus tutorials have been the best attended at their events, including
his tutorials &#8220;Real World Applications of Semantic Web&#8221; at WWW2007;
&#8220;Service Oriented Architectures and Semantic Web Processes&#8221; at the
International Conference on Web Services 2004; &#8220;Workflow Automation:
Applications, Technology, and Research,&#8221; at SIGMOD 1995; and
&#8220;Federated Databases for Managing Distributed, Heterogeneous, and
