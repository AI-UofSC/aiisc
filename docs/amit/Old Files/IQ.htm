<p><font SIZE="-1">With increasingly pervasive global information infrastructure,
we continue to face more quantity, more distribution, more autonomy, and
more heterogeneity among the accessible information, information sources,
and users. We need to deal with more heterogeneous information consisting
not only of a broader variety of digital data, but also operations and
computations (such as simulations) that can create new data and information.
The scale of the problem has changed from a few databases to millions of
information resources, and the new resources are added independently to
the accessible set of resources, as other resources change rapidly or disappear.
Currently favorite strategies that depend on keyword-based access or involve
only representational or structural components of data are usually found
to provide a poor quality of result, and their lack of precision leads
to increasing information overload. We fully expect increasing standardization
and interoperability at system, syntactic, and structural levels to address
many issues. However, the key challenges to be faced are at the semantic
level, where people would increasingly expect the information systems to
help them not at the data level, but at the information, and increasingly
knowledge levels. The InfoQuilt project utilizes the progress in system,
syntactic and structural interoperability, while developing new solutions
to achieve <b><i>semantic interoperability</i></b>. Its contributions so
far have been in developing an <b><i>information brokering</i></b> architecture,
specification and processing of media-independent <b><i>information correlations</i></b>
(called MREFs), and developing technique to exploit <b><i>multiple, pre-existing
ontologies</i></b>.</font>

<p><font SIZE="-1">We believe that semantic interoperability is the key to
progress towards our vision of <b>Infocosm</b>-- a society whose members
will have information anywhere, any time, and in many forms, for knowledge
creation and use, effective decision-making, better learning, and more
fun.</font>

<br>Details

<p><font SIZE="-1">InfoQuilt investigates three enablers and capabilities
to achieve semantic interoperability:</font>

<p><font SIZE="-1"><b>Terminology (and language) transparency</b>: This will
allow a user to choose an ontology of his or her choice (e.g., one based
on LCC for querying bibliographic data or FGDC for geospatial data), while
allowing the information source to subscribe to a related but different
ontology (e.g., an ontology based on DDC or UDK, respectively. The latter
recognizes some overlap between geospatial data sets and environmental
data sets, and their respective modeling).</font>

<p><font SIZE="-1"><b>Context-sensitive information processing</b>: The information
system will recognize or understand the context of an information need
and use it to limit information overload, both by formulating more precise
queries used for searching information sources and by filtering and transforming
the information before presenting it to the user.</font>

<p><font SIZE="-1"><b>Semantic correlation</b>: This allows the representation
of semantically-related information regardless of distribution and heterogeneity
(including various forms of media) by the user or the third party, and
their use for obtaining all forms of relevant information anywhere. We
have proposed the concept of Metadata REFerence link (MREF) to represent
and support corresponding information processing.</font>

<p><font SIZE="-1">The InfoQuilt system uses an <b><i>information brokering</i></b>
architecture, which adapts and extends the concepts of (1) federated environments
(Heimbigner and McLeod 1985; Sheth and Larson 1990) in which resources,
metadata, and ontologies are created, administered, and enhanced independently;
and (2) mediator architectures (Wiederhold 1992) which involve decoupling
information creators and providers from information users and better semantic-level
services and interoperability. Three key components of our approach are
metadata (especially domain-specific and content-based metadata), contexts,
and ontologies. We characterize InfoQuilt as the <u>third general information
integration system</u>, or a second-generation global information system.

<p><font SIZE="-1">&nbsp;The MIDAS system represents our early work on supporting
correlation of information stored in&nbsp; image and structured data. The
set of objects satisfying constraints on both the image and structured&nbsp;
representations may be considered as a logical collection using the InfoHarness
terminology.&nbsp;&nbsp; Attribute-based access to such a collection is
demonstrated here. <font COLOR="#CC0000">&lt;add MIDAS demo link&gt;</font></font><font SIZE="-1"></font>

<p><font SIZE="+1">OBSERVER:</font><font SIZE="-1"> <b>Ontology Based System
Enhanced with Relationships for Vocabulary hEterogeneity Resolution</b></font><b><font SIZE="-1"></font></b>

<p><font SIZE="-1">OBSERVER supports multiple pre-existing ontologies to
access heterogeneous, distributed and independently developed data repositories.&nbsp;
The content of each data repository is described by one or more ontologies
expressed in a system based on Description Logics (DLs).&nbsp; Each data
repository is viewed at the level of the relevant semantic concepts.&nbsp;
Information requests in OBSERVER are specified using concepts in a domain
ontology chosen by the user.&nbsp; OBSERVER users ontological inferences
to determine relevant data repositories and translated DL expressions to
the local query languages of the relevant data repositories.&nbsp; The
query processing allows controlled expansion of a user's query to involve
other ontologies using an extended set of relatonships including synonyms,
homonyms and hypernyms.&nbsp; We have also addressed the crucial issue
of estimating the possible loss of information when using relationships
othr then synonyms.</font>
