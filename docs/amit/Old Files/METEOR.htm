<P>Overview

<P><IMG SRC="nsf_logo_small.gif" HEIGHT=126 WIDTH=159 ALIGN=RIGHT>Workflow
management techniques developed in the METEOR (Managing End-To-End OpeRations)
project at the LSDIS lab are intended to reliably support large-scale,
complex and adaptive workflow applications in real-world multi-enterprise
heterogeneous computing environments.&nbsp; An important aspect of this
project is that the technology and system development effort at LSDIS has
occurred in close collaboration with its industry partners.&nbsp; Our research
builds upon earlier work in industry since 1990, and involves both vigorous
research program as well as technology transfer resulting in a <A HREF="http://infocosm.com">commercially
available product</A>.

<P>Architecture Overview<FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The METEOR workflow management system (WfMS) consists
of the METEOR Designer/Builder (MTDes), a repository, and two workflow
enactment systems (or workflow engines) - WebWork and ORBWork.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The METEOR designer (MTDes) is a tool kit to visually
design and build workflows.&nbsp; The functionality of the METEOR workflow
designer has been tailored so that it allows for almost-complete automatic
code generation for a workflow application ready to execute in a distributed,
heterogeneous environment.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>ORBWork is, we believe, the first CORBA+Java based fully
distributed workflow enactment system. In addition to providing coordination
capabilities in a heterogeneous and distributed environment, ORBWork supports
scalable software architecture, access to heterogeneous databases, as well
as an error detection and recovery framework that uses transactional concepts.&nbsp;
ORBWork uses ORBIXWeb and ORBIX Naming services from <A HREF="http://iona.com">Iona</A>.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>WebWork is a fully distributed Web-based workflow enactment
service that exploits the latest Internet/Web technologies.&nbsp; As compare
to ORBWork, it is a “light weight” implementation, more ubiquitous Web
servers (compared to CORBA ), but currently with a somewhat limited support
for scalability and dynamic changes.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>METEOR Designer</FONT></H1>
<FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The METEOR designer (MTDes) is a tool kit to visually
design and build workflows.&nbsp; It has two design modes.&nbsp; The first
mode, called Process Modeler, is aimed as a tool for the management of
a typical enterprise.&nbsp; A workflow design may be initiated at the high,
organizational level, without worrying about implementation details.&nbsp;
This mode focuses on high-level specification issues without going into
the procedural issues of the runtime.&nbsp; The Process Modeler stresses
the what of the process rather than the how.&nbsp; The second mode, called
Workflow Builder, is closer to the implementation aspects of creating a
workflow application.&nbsp; Technical engineers or system analysts who
would know the details of the underlying run time system would use this
mode. The design specification created with the Process Modeler is refined
in a more fine-grained manner using the Workflow Builder to create a complete
workflow application.&nbsp; It is in this mode that we specify the entire
map of the workflow including various tasks, task managers, and their interactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
As has been mentioned earlier, the tool has a graphical user interface.&nbsp;
The designer has several components, including the map designer, the data
designer, and the task designer. These components can model:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>the workflow map expressing the ordering of tasks and the
dependencies among them,</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>the data objects manipulated and transmitted by the tasks,</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>the details of the individual tasks (workflow activities),
and</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>the interface to external task development tools (e.g., Microsoft's
FrontPage to design the interface of a user task, or a rapid application
development tool).</FONT></LI>
</UL>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The functionality of the METEOR workflow designer has been
tailored so that it allows for almost-complete automatic code generation
for a complete workflow application. User tasks involving human interactions
and database tasks are automatically generated.&nbsp; For the computer
(automatic) tasks including those accessing legacy systems, wrapper code
is generated to utilize an executable code. Each runtime (ORBWork and WebWork)
has a suitable code generator.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>Workflow specified by the designer can also be stored
in the METEOR repository (which can be accessed using a WfMC API).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Current designer version 2.4 is C++ based and runs on
Windows95, NT and Sun/Solaris.&nbsp; A fully Java-based designer is due
to be completed in Q4'98.&nbsp; Additional capabilities it is expected
to support include design and specification for exception handling and
recovery, security (including multi-level security), and correctness of
specification. A METEOR-CD with the designer, multimedia tutorial, documentation,
etc. is available to faculty members teaching&nbsp; graduate courses involving
workflow management from the LSDIS lab, or for commercial use evaluation
from <A HREF="http://infocosm.com">Infocosm, Inc</A>.</FONT>
