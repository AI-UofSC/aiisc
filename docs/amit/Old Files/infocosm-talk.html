<P>The last decade belonged to computing.&nbsp; The next decade will belong
to communication.&nbsp; Beyond that, the future promises to belong to
<BR>information where we will increasingly realize that information is
power, information brings enlightenment.&nbsp; This talk briefly reviews
<BR>the explosive growth in computing and commuication, promises of the
current journey over "information superhighway" and electronic
<BR>commerce, and the challenges on the way to the desitnation infocosm.

<P>Our vision of the future is captured by the term "infocosm", which characterizes
a society whose members ("organisms") can have more
<BR>effective decision making capabilities (to support any of their activities)
using information that is available whenever needed, at any place, and
in (m)any form(s).&nbsp; The two key issues in the long-term vision of
the infocosm are the emphases on the terms "organisms" - the members of
the society, and "information" - used to support decision making (as opposed
to data, which is what is implied even as the term "information" is used
in "information superhighway").&nbsp; When such avision is achieved, seamless
access and intelligent use of local or world-wide data of many types can
significantly enhance the
<BR>information processing capabilities for all varieties of applications.

<P>Enabling infocosm requires that we supplement our ability to exchange
and share data with the ability to create and use information that may
<BR>be based on data of all types of media.&nbsp; To this end, we will
discuss the issues of data, metadata, context, ontology, and semantics,
with
<BR>respect to the data and applications that are local, remote, distributed,
and heterogeneous.&nbsp; Where appropriate, we will use our
<BR>research in the InfoHarness* and InfoQuilt projects to give examples
and insights.&nbsp; We believe that it is the progress on dealing with
<BR>information rather than data and communication, that will distinguish
leaders from the followers in the long term.

It is marketed by Bellcore as a commercial name under the name Adapt
<BR>X/Harness.

<P>Dr. Amit Sheth directs the Large Scale Distributed Information Systems
(LSDIS) Lab, is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the
<BR>University of Georgia, and an Adj. Assoc. Professor in the College
of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology.&nbsp; Earlier
<BR>he worked for nine years in the R&amp;D labs at Bellcore, Unisys, and
Honeywell.&nbsp; His primary current research interests include
<BR>workflow automation (project METEOR), management of heterogeneous digital
data and semantic issues in global information systems
<BR>(project InfoHarness and InfoQuilt), and electronic/information commerce.

<P>Prof. Sheth has led projects on heterogeneous DDBMS, factory information
system, integration of AI-database systems (project/system
<BR>BrAID), transactional workflows (PROMT and METEOR), federated database
tools (BERDI and TAILOR), multidatabase consistency, and data quality
<BR>(Q-Data).&nbsp; LSDIS lab (http://www.cs.uga.edu/LSDIS) maintains active
collaboration with industry, and has won significant funded projects
<BR>in the areas of interoperable and global information system.

<P>Prof. Sheth has published over 80 papers in the areas of federated databases,
workflow management, multidatabase consistency, metadata
<BR>and information modeling, and data consistency and semantics.&nbsp;
He has participated in over 30 program/organization committees for
<BR>conferences, serves on five journals, given over 50 invited and colloquia
talks and 14 tutorials, and lead two international
<BR>conferences and a workshop as a General/Program (Co-)Chair. Currently,
he is a General (Co-)Chair of the Intl. Conference on
<BR>Cooperative Information Systems, the Program Chair of the NSF Workshop
on Workflow and Process Automation, and is on the editorial board of
<BR>five journals.&nbsp; He has also served twice as an ACM Lecturer.
