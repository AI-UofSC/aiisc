<h1>Prospective Students</h1>

Before you contact me or other professors, here are some initial steps and information to consider:
<ul>
	<li>
		Read responses from Quora on the question: <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-do-I-write-the-first-email-to-a-professor-that-may-accept-me-as-his-graduate-student">How do I write the first email to a professor that may accept me as his graduate student?</a>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Look over my <a href="https://www.quora.com/Amit-Sheth-1/answers" target="_blank">answers on Quora</a> about graduate studies, MS vs. PhD, etc. Also look over topics that interest you, such as: <a href="http://qr.ae/RoWNYF" target="_blank">Joys of doing a PhD</a>, 
		<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-best-thing-that-you-learned-during-the-course-of-earning-your-Ph-D" target="_blank">Things you learn during a PhD</a>, 
		<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-defines-a-truly-exceptional-PhD-advisor" target="_blank">What makes an exceptional advisor?</a>, 
		<a href="http://qr.ae/RoUs87" target="_blank">Trusting an advisor</a>, and 
		<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-primary-causes-of-conflict-between-PhD-advisors-and-their-students" target="_blank">Conflicts with an advisor</a>.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Review the <a href="http://knoesis.org/aboutus/joiningus/joiningfaq">FAQ</a> about joining us at Kno.e.sis. Be sure to pay close attention to the links at the bottom.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Review the Kno.e.sis Center's page on <a href="http://knoesis.org/node/55">Financial Assistantship</a>.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Review my current research agenda. (See my SlideShare account, recent publications, etc., information about alumni, and try communicating with current students.)
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Be aware that while funding may be available for excellent PhD applicants whose research is a good match from the start, funding for MS students is usually reserved for those who are already in the U.S., those who have previously taken a course with me, and/or those who are planning to do MS thesis that is aligned with one of my funded research projects.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Many of my most successful PhD students came from other disciplines (statistics, mathematics, biomedicine, management, cognitive science), so it is not absolutely necessary to have a degree in computer science to join my group.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		How to write an e-mail (from <a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1795">PhD Comics</a>).
	</li>
	
	<li>
		In case the person writing a letter of recommendation for you does not have much experience, please share <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Grad-School-Recos/">this link</a> with him/her.

<strong>For Undergraduate Students at WSU Interested in Research, Projects, or Hands-on Experience</strong>
<p>
We are always open for undergraduate students to join us to improve their skills and gain more experience. You already need to be comfortable in programming (e.g., Java, Web programming, Android/mobile programming, UI/UX/visualization, databases, etc.). For students involved in research projects, funding is often available once we know you can contribute to a project.

<br><br>
For undergraduates at WSU interested in doing graduate studies, funding is often available that can make all your graduate studies free for you.

<br><br>
For U.S. high school and undergraduate students interested in summer internships, though you do not need to be not be WSU student, there are opportunities available.

<strong>For International Students Interested in Summer Internships</strong>

<p>
Unfortunately, unless you have previously worked with my research group, your advisor has worked with me, or you are studying with institutions (e.g., some IIITs) with whom we have dual degree programs and credit transfer arrangements, I am unable to offer summer internships. Both the limitations for those who are not registered as students in the U.S. (the effort it takes to obtain U.S. visas) and general funding issues prevent me from encouraging this.
