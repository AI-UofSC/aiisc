 Amit Sheth is an Educator, Researcher and Entrepreneur. He is the LexisNexis Ohio Eminent Scholar, an IEEE Fellow, and the executive director of Kno.e.sis — the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing. Kno.e.sis is a multidisciplinary Ohio Center of Excellence in BioHealth Innovation involving computer scientists, cognitive scientists, biomedical researchers and extensive clinical collaborations. It has the largest US academic research group in the area of Semantic Web. It also maintains a very high publication impact in World Wide Web (WWW); in recent years, sharing 2nd place among universities in the world for 5-yr impact (<a href="http://j.mp/www-Mar13">http://j.mp/www-Mar13</a>) and 10-yr impact (<a href="http://j.mp/www-Jun14">http://j.mp/www-Jun14</a>). 
 <br>
 
 <br>
 Earlier, Dr. Sheth was a professor at the University of Georgia, where he started the LSDIS lab in 1994. His professional appointments also include senior scientist/staff positions in R&D groups at Bellcore, Unisys, and Honeywell, as well as founding/co-founding and managing three startups in the roles of COB, CEO, SrVP, CTO and Chief Scientist.
 <br>
 
 <br>
 Sheth is working towards a vision of Computing for Human Experience incorporating semantics-empowered Physical-Cyber-Social computing. His recent work focuses on Web 3.0 involving enterprise, social, sensor/IoT data and applications, as well as services and cloud interoperability. o	In the past, he has worked extensively on federated databases, semantic interoperability and workflow management. Since founding Kno.e.sis, he has predominately been involved in multidisciplinary research with key collaboration and application areas in healthcare and life sciences (including, biomedicine, translational, and public health), defense/intelligence, manufacturing science, human/social/economic development, etc. He is also intimately involved in open source activities, social entrepreneurship, technology transfer and licensing, and commercialization, as he continues to seek real-world impact of research.
 <br>

<br>
<strong>As an educator</strong>: Sheth’s most prized achievement is the exceptional success of his past advisees, all of whom have successfully competed against graduates from top universities. Several of his students have received prestigious international awards and fellowships and mention in numerous articles in top media. Two of them have given keynotes at significant events before completing their PhD and nine (a majority) of his 17 former PhD advisees have over 1000 citations each, including two with approximately 5,000 citations each, and one who places 5th in WWW based on 10-yr impact in the world.   
They are employed at major research universities (North Carolina State Univ., Case Western Reserve Univ., etc.), top industry research labs (IBM Research Almaden and Watson, Samsung Research, etc.), top technology companies (CISCO, Amazon, etc), hold executive positions and are successful entrepreneurs. Their high demand is demonstrated by first year compensation exceeding $200K for a PhD advisee and $120K for recent MS advisees. 

<br>
<br>
Sheth has demonstrated academic initiatives and innovations in the form of initiating/advising new academic programs (most recently on Big and Smart Data Sciences), being among the first in the world in offering courses on emerging topics (Internet Programing in 2000, Enterprise Information Systems & Distributed Workflow in 1995, Global/Web Information Systems in 1995, Semantic Web in 2001, Web 3.0 in 2013, etc.), on-line teaching, international educational and research collaborations, and extensive tutorial presentations to academic and professional audiences.<br>

<br>
<strong>As a researcher</strong>: His h-index of 87 (i100 > 72) and 29,000+ citations to his publications places him among the top 100 in all of Computer Science in the world for computer science (37th based on 10 yr impact, 79th all years), top 1-3 in WWW (based on 5, 10 or all-years), and top 20 in databases (all years) [based on top authors list from Microsoft Academic Search checked on Mar. 13: <a href="http://j.mp/MAS-a">http://j.mp/MAS-a</a>]. He has been a PI of numerous competitive research grants, totaling around $20 million, sponsored by federal agencies (NSF, NIH, NIST, DARPA, AFRL, etc) as well as industry (Microsoft Research, IBM Research, HP labs, etc.). Additionally, more than $5 million has been awarded to support his technology commercialization and R&D efforts. During 2010 and 2011, his own research expenditures exceeded $1 million/year (directly supporting approximately 25 students and postdocs including 15-18 PhD students) and $2million for the Kno.e.sis Center. He is on several journal editorial boards (including IEEE Internet Computing), is the founding EIC of the International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems (IJSWIS), joint EIC of Distributed and Parallel Databases (DAPD), and a co-editor of two Springer book series (Semantic Web and Beyond: computing for Human Experience, and Advanced Database Systems). He has (co-)organized over 100 international events (conferences/workshops), served on 200+ PCs and given 49 keynotes.<br>

<br>
<strong>As an Entrepreneur, Technologist, Executive and Leader with Real-World Impact</strong>: Sheth's research has led to founding of three companies (one acquired, one sustaining, and one recently formed) which have resulted in significant regional impact and development of high-tech jobs. His work has also resulted in several commercial products and many deployed applications in financial, <a href="http://knoesis.org/amit/hcls">health care, biomedical</a> and Internet domains. He has a long history of leading multidisciplinary, multi-institutional and multinational activities. In the areas of health care and life sciences areas, his intensive collaborations with clinicians as well as biomedical researchers, have resulting in a large number of research and commercial tools, systems and applications.<br>

<br>
As a leader, he has been able to demonstrate ability to create world-class entities to achieve unprecedented institutional outcomes. Kno.e.sis with its ability to position Wright State University among the top 10 in the world in the area of World Wide Web, and earlier similar success for the LSDIS lab and University of Georgia are key exemplars. His leadership approach includes ability to create a strong ecosystem with focus on vision, people, and resources. He has pursued vision with a multidisciplinary scope placing bets of high risk and high reward topics well before those topics have ascended the hype curve, developed highly collaborative environment that attracts exceptional members (e.g., faculty, staff, student), personally and collectively securing highly competitive funds, and ensuring exceptional outcomes (e.g., student success, significantly enhanced faculty productivity since joining the center/lab, IP creation and licensing, technology transfer and regional economic development). For the companies he has founded, he has also played executive roles encompassing Chairman of the Board, President and CEO, SrVP, CTO and Chief Scientist, supervising a full range of activities including fund raising, finance, customer acquisition/sales, business development and marketing, engineering, recruiting and training. His second company grew to approximately~35 employees (with a majority coming from the university) and spent $7M in local payroll before it was acquired. He has served (and continues to serve) on technology and business advisory broads and in a variety of advising roles including international research projects, academic programs, and startups. He has had a long-term interest in higher education, and has given a number of presentations covering policy and strategic issues to policy and decision-makers. <br>
