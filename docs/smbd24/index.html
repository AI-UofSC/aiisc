                This tutorial introduces a neuro-symbolic AI framework to analyze big data from social media platforms. Integrating human-curated knowledge through symbolic AI with the pattern recognition capabilities of neural networks enhances the adaptability and efficiency of traditional neural network approaches. Knowledge-guided zero-shot learning techniques enable swift adaption to new linguistic contexts and emerging events [6]. Participants will explore how to design, develop, and utilize these models in specific domains, such as public health surveillance that require dynamic adaptation to new terminologies. The tutorial aims to equip attendees with practical skills and a deep understanding of how to apply neuro-symbolic AI to manage and analyze large-scale social media datasets effectively.
